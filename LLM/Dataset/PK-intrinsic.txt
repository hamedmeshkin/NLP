No	For both orally and intravenously administered drug, the duration of action is dose related and also bears a linear relationship to the logarithm of plasma atenolol concentration. 
No	In normal subjects, the beta1 selectivity of atenolol has been shown by its reduced ability to reverse the beta2-mediated vasodilating effect of isoproterenol as compared to equivalent beta-blocking doses of propranolol. 
No	In asthmatic patients, a dose of atenolol producing a greater effect on resting heart rate than propranolol resulted in much less increase in airway resistance.

No	Narcotics, atropine and magnesium-aluminum hydroxide have also been reported to slow the absorption of mexiletine. 
No	Plasma levels within the therapeutic range can be attained with either three times daily or twice daily dosing but peak to trough differences are greater with the latter regimen, creating the possibility of adverse effects at peak and arrhythmic escape at trough. 
Yes	Since mexiletine is metabolized in the liver, and hepatic impairment has been reported to prolong the elimination half-life of mexiletine, patients with liver disease should be followed carefully while receiving mexiletine. 
No	Since mexiletine hydrochloride is a substrate for the metabolic pathways involving CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 enzymes, inhibition or induction of either of these enzymes would be expected to alter mexiletine plasma concentrations.

No	In another formal study (n = 8 extensive and n = 7 poor metabolizers of CYP2D6), coadministration of propafenone did not alter the kinetics of mexiletine in the poor CYP2D6 metabolizer group. 
Yes	However, the metabolic clearance of mexiletine in the extensive metabolizer phenotype decreased by about 70% making the poor and extensive metabolizer groups indistinguishable.

Yes	It may be necessary to reduce the clozapine tablets dose in patients with significant renal or hepatic impairment, or in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers [see Use in Specific Populations (, )]. 
No	Concomitant treatment with inhibitors of these enzymes can increase the concentration of clozapine tablets [see Drug Interactions () and Clinical Pharmacology ()]. 
No	Concomitant use of clozapine tablets and CYP1A2 inhibitors can increase plasma levels of clozapine, potentially resulting in adverse reactions. 
No	Reduce the clozapine tablets dose to one-third of the original dose when clozapine tablets are coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, or enoxacin).

Yes	Aging may affect the pharmacokinetics of verapamil given to hypertensive patients. 
Yes	Hepatic and Renal Failure: Significant hepatic and renal failure should not increase the effects of a single intravenous dose of Verapamil HCI but may prolong its duration. 
Yes	The most commonly used single doses in patients up to 12 months of age have ranged from 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg of body weight, while in patients aged 1 to 15 years, the most commonly used single doses ranged from 0.1 to 0.3 mg/kg of body weight.

No	The systemic availability and half-life of metoprolol in patients with renal failure do not differ to a clinically significant degree from those in normal subjects. 
No	Metoprolol produces a decrease in sinus heart rate in most patients; this decrease is greatest among patients with high initial heart rates and least among patients with low initial heart rates. 
Yes	Metoprolol should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function.

No	Sotalol shows very little intersubject variability in plasma levels. 
No	The pharmacokinetics of the d and l enantiomers of sotalol are essentially identical. 
No	Sotalol crosses the blood brain barrier poorly. 
Yes	Excretion is predominantly via the kidney in the unchanged form, and therefore lower doses are necessary in conditions of renal impairment (see ). Age per se does not significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of sotalol, but impaired renal function in geriatric patients can increase the terminal elimination half-life, resulting in increased drug accumulation. 
No	Since sotalol is not subject to first-pass metabolism, patients with hepatic impairment show no alteration in clearance of sotalol. 
Yes	Avoiding excessive accumulation of sotalol in patients with diminished renal function, by appropriate dose reduction, should also reduce the risk of proarrhythmia (see ). 
Yes	There is a direct relationship between renal function, as measured by serum creatinine or creatinine clearance, and the elimination rate of sotalol. 
No	Sotalol is not expected to inhibit or induce any CYP450 enzymes; therefore, it is not expected to alter the PK of drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes. 
No	Graded dose adjustment will help prevent the usage of doses which are higher than necessary to control the arrhythmia. 
No	Because of the long terminal elimination half-life of sotalol, dosing on more than a BID regimen is usually not necessary. 
Yes	Because sotalol is excreted predominantly in urine and its terminal elimination half-life is prolonged in conditions of renal impairment, the dosing interval (time between divided doses) of sotalol should be modified (when creatinine clearance is lower than 60 mL/min) according to the following table. 
Yes	Since the terminal elimination half-life of sotalol is increased in patients with renal impairment, a longer duration of dosing is required to reach steady-state. 
Yes	The half-life of sotalol is prolonged (up to 69 hours) in anuric patients. 
No	Sotalol elimination is predominantly via the kidney in the unchanged form. 
Yes	Use of sotalol in any age group with decreased renal function should be at lower doses or at increased intervals between doses. 
No	The beta-blocking effects also tended to be greater in the smaller children (BSA 0.33m2). 
Yes	Note that these doses were given twice or once daily, depending on renal function. 
No	After rapid absorption with peak levels occurring on average between 2 to 3 hours following administration, sotalol was eliminated with a mean half-life of 9.5 hours. 
Yes	The average peak to trough concentration ratio was 2. BSA was the most important covariate and more relevant than age for the pharmacokinetics of sotalol.

Yes	For children aged about 2 years and greater with normal renal function, doses normalized for body surface area are appropriate for both initial and incremental dosing. 
Yes	At least 36 hours should be allowed between dose increments to attain steady-state plasma concentrations of sotalol in patients with age-adjusted normal renal function. 
Yes	For children aged about 2 years or younger the above pediatric dosage should be reduced by a factor that depends heavily upon age, as shown in the following graph, age plotted on a logarithmic scale in months. 
Yes	For a child aged 20 months, the dosing suggested for children with normal renal function aged 2 years or greater should be multiplied by about 0.97; the initial starting dose would be (30 00D7> 0.97) =29.1 mg/m2, administered three times daily. 
Yes	For a child aged 1 month, the starting dose should be multiplied by 0.68; the initial starting dose would be (30 00D7> 0.68) = 20 mg/m2, administered three times daily. 
Yes	Since the half-life of sotalol decreases with decreasing age (below about 2 years), time to steady-state will also increase. 
No	Thus, in neonates the time to steady-state may be as long as a week or longer. 
No	Relative to a solution of quinidine sulfate, the bioavailability of quinidine from quinidine gluconate is reported to be 1.03. 
No	The less-than-complete bioavailability is thought to be due to first-pass elimination by the liver. 
Yes	The volume of distribution of quinidine is 2 to 3 L/kg in healthy young adults, but this may be reduced to as little as 0.5 L/kg in patients with congestive heart failure, or increased to 3 to 5 L/kg in patients with cirrhosis of the liver. 
Yes	At concentrations of 2 to 5 mg/L (6.5 to 16.2 00B5>mol/L), the fraction of quinidine bound to plasma proteins (mainly to 03B1>1-acid glycoprotein and to albumin) is 80 to 88% in adults and older children, but it is lower in pregnant women, and in infants and neonates it may be as low as 50 to 70%. 
Yes	Because 03B1>1-acid glycoprotein levels are increased in response to stress, serum levels of total quinidine may be greatly increased in settings such as acute myocardial infarction, even though the serum content of unbound (active) drug may remain normal. 
Yes	Quinidine clearance typically proceeds at 3 to 5 mL/min/kg in adults, but clearance in children may be twice or three times as rapid. 
Yes	The elimination half-life is 6 to 8 hours in adults and 3 to 4 hours in children. 
No	Quinidine clearance is unaffected by hepatic cirrhosis, so the increased volume of distribution seen in cirrhosis leads to a proportionate increase in the elimination half-life. 
Yes	When renal function is taken into account, quinidine clearance is apparently independent of patient age. 
Yes	Renal or hepatic dysfunction causes the elimination of quinidine to be slowed, while congestive heart failure causes a reduction in quinidine 2019>s apparent volume of distribution. 
No	Diltiazem significantly decreases the clearance and increases the t1/2 of quinidine, but quinidine does not alter the kinetics of diltiazem. 
No	Quinidine slows the elimination of digoxin and simultaneously reduces digoxin 2019>s apparent volume of distribution. 
No	Testing with debrisoquine is sometimes used to distinguish the P450IID6- deficient 201C>poor metabolizers 201D> from the majority-phenotype 201C>extensive metabolizers 201D>. 
Yes	When drugs whose metabolism is P450IID6-dependent are given to poor metabolizers, the serum levels achieved are higher, sometimes much higher, than the serum levels achieved when identical doses are given to extensive metabolizers. 
Yes	To obtain similar clinical benefit without toxicity, doses given to poor metabolizers may need to be greatly reduced. 
Yes	In the case of prodrugs whose actions are actually mediated by P450IID6- produced metabolites (for example, codeine and hydrocodone, whose analgesic and antitussive effects appear to be mediated by morphine and hydromorphone, respectively), it may not be possible to achieve the desired clinical benefits in poor metabolizers. 
No	Quinidine is not metabolized by cytochrome P450IID6, but therapeutic serum levels of quinidine inhibit the action of cytochrome P450IID6, effectively converting extensive metabolizers into poor metabolizers. 
No	The level of quinidine in amniotic fluid was about three times higher than that found in serum. 
No	Quinidine is present in human milk at levels slightly lower than those in maternal serum; a human infant ingesting such milk should (scaling directly by weight) be expected to develop serum quinidine levels at least an order of magnitude lower than those of the mother. 
No	Notwithstanding the known pharmacokinetic differences between children and adults (see), children in these trials received the same doses (on a mg/kg basis) as adults. 
Yes	The dosage of quinidine varies considerably depending upon the general condition and the cardiovascular state of the patient. 
No	After initiation of therapy, steady-state concentrations for tamoxifen are achieved in about 4 weeks and steady-state concentrations for N-desmethyl tamoxifen are achieved in about 8 weeks, suggesting a half-life of approximately 14 days for this metabolite. 
No	In a steady-state, crossover study of 10 mg tamoxifen citrate tablets given twice a day vs. a 20 mg tamoxifen citrate tablet given once daily, the 20 mg tamoxifen citrate tablet was bioequivalent to the 10 mg tamoxifen citrate tablets. 
No	Excretion: Studies in women receiving 20 mg of 14C tamoxifen have shown that approximately 65% of the administered dose was excreted from the body over a period of 2 weeks with fecal excretion as the primary route of elimination. 
No	Special Populations: The effects of age, gender and race on the pharmacokinetics of tamoxifen have not been determined. 
No	The effects of reduced liver function on the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of tamoxifen have not been determined. 
No	Pediatric Patients: Approved labeling describing pediatric pharmacokinetic information obtained from patients with McCune-Albright syndrome is available for AstraZeneca's tamoxifen citrate tablets. 
No	The magnitude of blood pressure reduction is related to the degree of hypertension; thus hypertensive individuals experience an antihypertensive effect, whereas there is only a modest fall in blood pressure in normotensives. 
No	There is a departure from linearity when dose strengths are increased; the half-life is slightly increased with dose. 
Yes	A study that compared patients with normal hepatic function to patients with cirrhosis found an increase in half-life and a 69% increase in bioavailability in the hepatically impaired patients. 
No	A single study in patients with severely impaired renal function showed no difference in the pharmacokinetic profile of diltiazem compared to patients with normal renal function. 
No	As the dose of diltiazem is increased from 120 to 240 mg, area-under-the-curve increases 2.5-fold. 
No	Resting heart rate is usually slightly reduced by diltiazem. 
No	Diltiazem had a larger effect to increase exercise tolerance at peak serum concentrations than at trough. 
Yes	The drug should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function. 
No	The effect may be mediated by cimetidine's known inhibition of hepatic cytochrome P-450, the enzyme system responsible for the first-pass metabolism of diltiazem. 
No	In a ten-subject study, coadministration of diltiazem (120 mg bid diltiazem SR) with lovastatin resulted in a 3 to 4 times increase in mean lovastatin AUC and Cmax versus lovastatin alone; no change in pravastatin AUC and Cmax was observed during diltiazem coadministration. 
No	Due to extensive metabolism, blood levels after a standard dose of diltiazem can vary over tenfold, limiting the usefulness of blood levels in overdose cases. 
Yes	Dosage needs to be adjusted by titration to individual patient needs. 
No	The time of dosing should be considered when making dose adjustments based on trough effects. 
No	Because of concentration-dependent protein binding, it is difficult to predict the concentration of the free drug when total drug is measured. 
Yes	In six patients with impaired renal function (creatinine clearance less than 40 mL/min), disopyramide half-life values were 8 to 18 hours. 
Yes	After the oral administration of immediate release disopyramide to 10 cardiac patients with borderline to moderate heart failure, the time to peak serum concentration was increased and the mean peak serum concentration was higher than in healthy volunteers. 
Yes	In a second study of the oral administration of disopyramide to 7 patients with heart disease, including left ventricular dysfunction, the mean plasma half-life was slightly prolonged to 7.8 00B1> 1.9 hours (range of 5 to 9.5 hours). 
No	In healthy men, about 50% of a given dose of disopyramide is excreted in the urine as the unchanged drug, about 20% as the mono-N-dealkylated metabolite and 10% as the other metabolites. 
No	Total bioavailability was shown to be similar to an immediate-release product. 
Yes	Urinary retention may occur in patients of either sex as a consequence of disopyramide phosphate administration, but males with benign prostatic hypertrophy are at particular risk. 
Yes	Therefore, disopyramide phosphate dosage should be reduced in patients with impaired renal function (see ). 
Yes	Hepatic impairment also causes an increase in the plasma half-life of disopyramide. 
Yes	Antiarrhythmic drugs may be ineffective in patients with hypokalemia, and their toxic effects may be enhanced in patients with hyperkalemia. 
No	Disopyramide phosphate does not increase serum digoxin levels.  
Yes	In case of any impaired renal function, measures to increase the glomerular filtration rate may reduce the toxicity (disopyramide is excreted primarily by the kidney). 
Yes	For patients whose body weight is less than 110 pounds (50 kg), the recommended dosage is 400 mg/day given in divided doses (200 mg every 12 hours for the extended-release product). 
No	Peak blood levels are reached in two to three hours. 
No	In normal subjects, the plasma elimination half-life of mexiletine is approximately 10 to 12 hours. 
No	Mexiletine is mainly metabolized in the liver, the primary pathway being CYP2D6 metabolism, although it is also a substrate for CYP1A2. 
No	With involvement of CYP2D6, there can be either poor or extensive metabolizer phenotypes. 
Yes	Since approximately 90% of mexiletine is metabolized in the liver into inactive metabolites, pathological changes in the liver can restrict hepatic clearance of mexiletine and its metabolites. 
Yes	Hepatic impairment prolongs the elimination half-life of mexiletine. 
Yes	In eight patients with moderate to severe liver disease, the mean half-life was approximately 25 hours.

Yes	In eight patients with creatinine clearance less than 10 ml/min, the mean plasma elimination half-life was 15.7 hours; in seven patients with creatinine clearance between 11 to 40 ml/min, the mean half-life was 13.4 hours. 
Yes	The absorption rate of mexiletine is reduced in clinical situations such as acute myocardial infarction in which gastric emptying time is increased. 
No	Plasma levels within the therapeutic range can be attained with either three times daily or twice daily dosing but peak to trough differences are greater with the latter regimen, creating the possibility of adverse effects at peak and arrhythmic escape at trough. 
Yes	Since mexiletine is metabolized in the liver, and hepatic impairment has been reported to prolong the elimination half-life of mexiletine, patients with liver disease should be followed carefully while receiving mexiletine. 
Yes	Avoiding excessive accumulation of sotalol in patients with diminished renal function, by appropriate dose reduction, should also reduce the risk of proarrhythmia (see ). 
No	Hypotension: (depending on associated factors) epinephrine rather than isoproterenol or norepinephrine may be useful. 
Yes	Because sotalol is excreted predominantly in urine and its terminal elimination half-life is prolonged in conditions of renal impairment, the dosing interval (time between divided doses) of sotalol should be modified (when creatinine clearance is lower than 60 mL/min) according to the following table. 
Yes	Extreme caution should be exercised in the use of sotalol in patients with renal failure undergoing hemodialysis. 
Yes	The half-life of sotalol is prolonged (up to 69 hours) in anuric patients. 
Yes	Use of sotalol in any age group with decreased renal function should be at lower doses or at increased intervals between doses.

Yes	Adjust the dosing interval based on creatinine clearance.. 
Yes	Dosing intervals should be adjusted based on creatinine clearance [see Dosage and Administration ()]. 
Yes	Excretion of sotalol is predominantly via the kidney in the unchanged form, and therefore lower doses are necessary in conditions of renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration ()]. 
Yes	Geriatric: Age does not significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of sotalol, but impaired renal function in geriatric patients can increase the terminal elimination half-life, resulting in increased drug accumulation. 
Yes	Renal Impairment: Sotalol is mainly eliminated via the kidneys through glomerular filtration and to a small degree by tubular secretion. 
No	Hepatic Impairment: Patients with hepatic impairment show no alteration in clearance of sotalol.

Yes	Dosing intervals should be adjusted based on creatinine clearance [ ]. 
No	Hypotension: (depending on associated factors) epinephrine rather than isoproterenol or norepinephrine may be useful. 
No	If the creatinine clearance is 40 mL/min Sotalol AF is contraindicated. 
Yes	2022> The dose of sotalol hydrochloride tablets (AF) must be individualized according to calculated creatinine clearance. 
Yes	In patients with a creatinine clearance >60 mL/min sotalol hydrochloride tablets (AF) are administered twice daily (BID) while in those with a creatinine clearance between 40 and 60 mL/min, the dose is administered once daily (QD). 
No	Measure serum creatinine and calculate an estimated creatinine clearance in order to establish the appropriate dosing interval. 
No	For a child aged 1 month, multiply the starting dose by 0.7; the initial starting dose would be (1.2 mg/kg X 0.7)=0.8

Yes	Adjust dosing intervals based on creatinine clearance [see Dosage and Administration ()]. 
No	For a child aged about 1 week, the initial starting dose should be multiplied by 0.3; the starting dose would be (30 X 0.3) =9 mg/m 2. Use similar calculations for dose titration. 
Yes	The intravenous loading dose depends on the target oral dose and creatinine clearance; the dosing interval for oral administration of sotalol and the minimum delay between the end of the infusion and the first oral dose also depend on renal function; see Table 2 [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]. 
Yes	With impaired renal function, start lower and titrate less frequently. 
Yes	Breakthrough arrhythmias may also occur during pregnancy, as therapeutic treatment levels may be difficult to maintain due to the increased volume of distribution and increased drug metabolism inherent in the pregnant state. 
No	The smallest children (BSA 0.33 m 2) showed a tendency for larger Class III effects ( 0394>QTc) and an increased frequency of prolongations of the QTc interval compared with children with BSA 2265>0.33 m 2. The beta-blocking effects also tended to be greater in the smaller children (BSA0.33

No	Intravenous disopyramide phosphate may cause cardiac depression with an approximate mean 10% reduction of cardiac output, which is more pronounced in patients with cardiac dysfunction. 
Yes	In six patients with impaired renal function (creatinine clearance less than 40 mL/min), disopyramide half-life values were 8 to 18 hours. 
Yes	After the oral administration of immediate release disopyramide to 10 cardiac patients with borderline to moderate heart failure, the time to peak serum concentration was increased and the mean peak serum concentration was higher than in healthy volunteers. 
Yes	In a second study of the oral administration of disopyramide to 7 patients with heart disease, including left ventricular dysfunction, the mean plasma half-life was slightly prolonged to 7.8 00B1> 1.9 hours (range of 5 to 9.5 hours). 
Yes	Urinary retention may occur in patients of either sex as a consequence of disopyramide phosphate administration, but males with benign prostatic hypertrophy are at particular risk. 
Yes	Therefore, disopyramide phosphate dosage should be reduced in patients with impaired renal function (see ). 
Yes	Hepatic impairment also causes an increase in the plasma half-life of disopyramide. 
Yes	This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. 
Yes	In case of any impaired renal function, measures to increase the glomerular filtration rate may reduce the toxicity (disopyramide is excreted primarily by the kidney). 
No	The dosage of disopyramide (as the phosphate) must be individualized for each patient on the basis of response and tolerance. 
Yes	For patients whose body weight is less than 110 pounds (50 kg), the recommended dosage is 400 mg/day given in divided doses (200 mg every 12 hours for the extended-release product). 
Yes	After the oral administration of 200 mg of disopyramide to 10 cardiac patients with borderline to moderate heart failure, the time to peak serum concentration of 2.3 00B1> 1.5 hours (mean 00B1> SD) was increased, and the mean peak serum concentration of 4.8 00B1> 1.6 mcg/mL was higher than in healthy volunteers. 
Yes	Therefore Disopyramide Phosphate dosage should be reduced in patients with impaired renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). 
Yes	Patients with cardiac dysfunction have a higher potential for hepatic impairment; this should be considered when administering Disopyramide Phosphate.

Yes	Oxaprozin tablets is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to oxaprozin may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. 
No	Only low concentrations are normally achieved in the spinal fluid, but passage of the drug across the blood-brain barrier increases in meningitis. 
Yes	Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicate that the plasma concentration of dofetilide in patients with supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, ischemic heart disease, or congestive heart failure are similar to those of healthy volunteers, after adjusting for renal function. 
Yes	After correction for renal function, clearance of dofetilide is not related to age.

Yes	In patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of unbound phenytoin concentrations may be more relevant [see ]. 
No	Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with the free acid form over that of the sodium salt, dosage adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt and vice versa. 
No	Concurrent administration of lorazepam with valproate may result in increased plasma concentrations and reduced clearance of lorazepam. 
No	Lorazepam dosage should be reduced to approximately 50% when coadministered with valproate. 
No	Concurrent administration of lorazepam with probenecid may result in a more rapid onset or prolonged effect of lorazepam due to increased half-life and decreased total clearance.

Yes	Elderly patients have decreased clearance of amlodipine with a resulting increase of AUC of approximately 40 to 60%, and a lower initial dose may be required [see Dosage and Administration ()]. 
No	Limited measurements of peak response (2 to 3 hours after dosing) during chronic terazosin administration indicate that it is greater than about twice the trough (24 hour) response, suggesting some attenuation of response at 24 hours, presumably due to a fall in blood terazosin concentrations at the end of the dose interval.
No	Administration of capsules immediately after meals had a minimal effect on the extent of absorption.

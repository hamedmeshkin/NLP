5	The following adverse reactions have been reported with the use of gold preparations and require modification of RIDAURA treatment or additional monitoring.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	See ADVERSE REACTIONS for the approximate incidence of those reactions specifically reported with RIDAURA.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Gastrointestinal Reactions: Gastrointestinal reactions reported with gold therapy include diarrhea/loose stools, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal cramps.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The most common reaction to RIDAURA is diarrhea/ loose stools reported in approximately 50% of the patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This is generally manageable by reducing the dosage (e.g., from 6 mg daily to 3 mg) and in only 6% of the patients is it necessary to discontinue RIDAURA (auranofin) permanently.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Ulcerative enterocolitis is a rare serious gold reaction.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, patients with gastrointestinal symptoms should be monitored for the appearance of gastrointestinal bleeding.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cutaneous Reactions: Dermatitis is the most common reaction to injectable gold therapy and the second most common reaction to RIDAURA.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Any eruption, especially if pruritic, that develops during treatment should be considered a gold reaction until proven otherwise.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Pruritus often exists before dermatitis becomes apparent, and therefore should be considered to be a warning signal of a cutaneous reaction.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Gold dermatitis may be aggravated by exposure to sunlight or an actinic rash may develop.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The most serious form of cutaneous reaction reported with injectable gold is generalized exfoliative dermatitis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Mucous Membrane Reactions: Stomatitis, another common gold reaction, may be manifested by shallow ulcers on the buccal membranes, on the borders of the tongue, and on the palate or in the pharynx.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Stomatitis may occur as the only adverse reaction or with a dermatitis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Sometimes diffuse glossitis or gingivitis develops.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A metallic taste may precede these oral mucous membrane reactions and should be considered a warning signal.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Renal Reactions: Gold can produce a nephrotic syndrome or glomerulitis with proteinuria and hematuria.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These renal reactions are usually relatively mild and subside completely if recognized early and treatment is discontinued.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	They may become severe and chronic if treatment is continued after the onset of the reaction.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore it is important to perform urinalyses regularly and to discontinue treatment promptly if proteinuria or hematuria develops.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hematologic Reactions: Blood dyscrasias including leukopenia, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia and aplastic anemia have all been reported as reactions to injectable gold and RIDAURA.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Thrombocytopenia has occurred in 1<U+2013>3% of patients treated with RIDAURA (auranofin), some of whom developed bleeding.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The thrombocytopenia usually appears to be peripheral in origin and is usually reversible upon withdrawal of RIDAURA.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Its onset bears no relationship to the duration of RIDAURA therapy and its course may be rapid.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	While patients' platelet counts should normally be monitored at least monthly, the occurrence of a precipitous decline in platelets or a platelet count less than 100,000/cu mm or signs and symptoms (e.g., purpura, ecchymoses or petechiae) suggestive of thrombocytopenia indicates a need to immediately withdraw RIDAURA and other therapies with the potential to cause thrombocytopenia, and to obtain additional platelet counts.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	No additional RIDAURA should be given unless the thrombocytopenia resolves and further studies show it was not due to gold therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Proteinuria has developed in 3-9% of patients treated with RIDAURA.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Medication errors with EXELON PATCH have resulted in serious adverse reactions; some cases have required hospitalization, and rarely, led to death.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The majority of medication errors have involved not removing the old patch when putting on a new one and the use of multiple patches at one time.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Instruct patients and their caregivers on important administration instructions for EXELON PATCH.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	EXELON PATCH can cause gastrointestinal adverse reactions, including significant nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia/decreased appetite, and weight loss.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The incidence and severity of these reactions are dose-related.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For this reason, initiate treatment with EXELON PATCH at a dose of 4.6 mg/24 hours, and titrate to a dose of 9.5 mg/24 hours and then to a dose of 13.3 mg/24 hours, if appropriate.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	It is critical to inform caregivers that if therapy has been interrupted for more than 3 days because of intolerance, the next dose should not be administered without contacting the physician regarding proper retitration.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Skin application-site reactions may occur with EXELON PATCH.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These reactions are not in themselves an indication of sensitization.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, use of rivastigmine patch may lead to allergic contact dermatitis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Allergic contact dermatitis should be suspected if application-site reactions spread beyond the patch size, if there is evidence of a more intense local reaction (e.g., increasing erythema, edema, papules, vesicles), and if symptoms do not significantly improve within 48 hours after patch removal.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In these cases, treatment should be discontinued.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In patients who develop application-site reactions to EXELON PATCH, suggestive of allergic contact dermatitis and who still require rivastigmine, treatment should be switched to oral rivastigmine only after negative allergy testing and under close medical supervision.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is possible that some patients sensitized to rivastigmine by exposure to rivastigmine patch may not be able to take rivastigmine in any form.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Clinical studies of rivastigmine have shown no significant increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Use with Anesthesia Rivastigmine, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cardiac Conduction Effects Because rivastigmine increases cholinergic activity, use of the EXELON PATCH may have vagotonic effects on heart rate (e.g., bradycardia).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The potential for this action may be particularly important in patients with sick sinus syndrome or other supraventricular cardiac conduction conditions.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In clinical trials, rivastigmine was not associated with any increased incidence of cardiovascular adverse events, heart rate or blood pressure changes, or electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Figure 2: Rivastigmine Plasma Concentrations Following Dermal 24-Hour Patch Application Although the precise mechanism of action of rivastigmine is unknown, it is thought to exert its therapeutic effect by enhancing cholinergic function.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This is accomplished by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine through reversible inhibition of its hydrolysis by cholinesterase.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effect of rivastigmine may lessen as the disease process advances and fewer cholinergic neurons remain functionally intact.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There is no evidence that rivastigmine alters the course of the underlying dementing process.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	After a 6-mg oral dose of rivastigmine in humans, anticholinesterase activity is present in cerebrospinal fluid for about 10 hours, with a maximum inhibition of about 60% 5 hours after dosing.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that the inhibition of cholinesterase by rivastigmine is not affected by the concomitant administration of memantine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Absorption After the initial application of EXELON PATCH, there is a lag time of 0.5 to 1 hour in the absorption of rivastigmine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concentrations then rise slowly typically reaching a maximum after 8 hours, although maximum values (Cmax) can also occur later (at 10 to 16 hours).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	After the peak, plasma concentrations slowly decrease over the remainder of the 24-hour period of application.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	At steady state, trough levels are approximately 60% to 80% of peak levels.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	EXELON PATCH 9.5 mg/24 hours gave exposure approximately the same as that provided by an oral dose of 6 mg twice daily (i.e., 12 mg/day).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Inter-subject variability in exposure was lower (43% to 49%) for the EXELON PATCH formulation as compared with the oral formulations (73% to 103%).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Fluctuation (between Cmax and Cmin) is less for EXELON PATCH than for the oral formulation of rivastigmine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Figure 2: Rivastigmine Plasma Concentrations Following Dermal 24-Hour Patch Application Over a 24-hour dermal application, approximately 50% of the drug content of the patch is released from the system.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Exposure area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC<U+221E>) to rivastigmine (and metabolite NAP266-90) was highest when the patch was applied to the upper back, chest, or upper arm.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Two other sites (abdomen and thigh) could be used if none of the 3 other sites is available, but the practitioner should be aware that the rivastigmine plasma exposure associated with these sites was approximately 20% to 30% lower.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There was no relevant accumulation of rivastigmine or the metabolite NAP226-90 in plasma in patients with Alzheimer<U+2019>s disease with daily dosing.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The pharmacokinetic profile of rivastigmine transdermal patches was comparable in patients with Alzheimer<U+2019>s disease and in patients with dementia associated with Parkinson<U+2019>s disease.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Distribution Rivastigmine is weakly bound to plasma proteins (approximately 40%) over the therapeutic range.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It readily crosses the blood-brain barrier, reaching CSF peak concentrations in 1.4 to 2.6 hours.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It has an apparent volume of distribution in the range of 1.8 to 2.7 L/kg.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Metabolism Rivastigmine is extensively metabolized primarily via cholinesterase-mediated hydrolysis to the decarbamylated metabolite NAP226-90.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In vitro, this metabolite shows minimal inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (less than 10%).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Based on evidence from in vitro and animal studies, the major cytochrome P450 isoenzymes are minimally involved in rivastigmine metabolism.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The metabolite-to-parent AUC<U+221E> ratio was about 0.7 after EXELON PATCH application versus 3.5 after oral administration, indicating that much less metabolism occurred after dermal treatment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Less NAP226-90 is formed following patch application, presumably because of the lack of presystemic (hepatic first pass) metabolism.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Based on in vitro studies, no unique metabolic routes were detected in human skin.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Elimination Renal excretion of the metabolites is the major route of elimination.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Unchanged rivastigmine is found in trace amounts in the urine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Following administration of 14C-rivastigmine, renal elimination was rapid and essentially complete (greater than 90%) within 24 hours.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Less than 1% of the administered dose is excreted in the feces.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The apparent elimination half-life in plasma is approximately 3 hours after patch removal.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Renal clearance was approximately 2.1 to 2.8 L/hr.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Age Age had no impact on the exposure to rivastigmine in Alzheimer<U+2019>s disease patients treated with EXELON PATCH.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Gender and Race No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate the effect of gender and race on the disposition of EXELON PATCH.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A population pharmacokinetic analysis of oral rivastigmine indicated that neither gender (n = 277 males and 348 females) nor race (n = 575 Caucasian, 34 Black, 4 Asian, and 12 Other) affected clearance of the drug.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Similar results were seen with analyses of pharmacokinetic data obtained after the administration of EXELON PATCH.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Body Weight A relationship between drug exposure at steady state (rivastigmine and metabolite NAP226-90) and body weight was observed in Alzheimer<U+2019>s dementia patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rivastigmine exposure is higher in subjects with low body weight.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Compared to a patient with a body weight of 65 kg, the rivastigmine steady-state concentrations in a patient with a body weight of 35 kg would be approximately doubled, while for a patient with a body weight of 100 kg the concentrations would be approximately halved.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Renal Impairment No study was conducted with EXELON PATCH in subjects with renal impairment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Based on population analysis, creatinine clearance did not show any clear effect on steady state concentrations of rivastigmine or its metabolite.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Following a single 3-mg dose, mean oral clearance of rivastigmine was 60% lower in hepatically impaired patients (n = 10, biopsy proven) than in healthy subjects (n = 10).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	After multiple 6-mg twice a day oral dosing, the mean clearance of rivastigmine was 65% lower in mild (n = 7, Child-Pugh score 5 to 6) and moderate (n = 3, Child-Pugh score 7 to 9) hepatically impaired patients (biopsy proven, liver cirrhosis) than in healthy subjects (n = 10).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Smoking Following oral rivastigmine administration (up to 12 mg/day) with nicotine use, population pharmacokinetic analysis showed increased oral clearance of rivastigmine by 23% (n = 75 smokers and 549 nonsmokers).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drug Interaction Studies No specific interaction studies have been conducted with EXELON PATCH.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Information presented below is from studies with oral rivastigmine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effect of Rivastigmine on the Metabolism of Other Drugs Rivastigmine is primarily metabolized through hydrolysis by esterases.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Minimal metabolism occurs via the major cytochrome P450 isoenzymes.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Based on in vitro studies, no pharmacokinetic drug interactions with drugs metabolized by the following isoenzyme systems are expected: CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP3A4/5, CYP2E1, CYP2C9, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, or CYP2B6.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between rivastigmine taken orally and digoxin, warfarin, diazepam, or fluoxetine in studies in healthy volunteers.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The increase in prothrombin time induced by warfarin is not affected by administration of rivastigmine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effect of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of Rivastigmine Drugs that induce or inhibit CYP450 metabolism are not expected to alter the metabolism of rivastigmine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia The risk of hypoglycemia after an injection is related to the duration of action of the insulin and, in general, is highest when the glucose lowering effect of the insulin is maximal.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	As with all insulin preparations, the glucose lowering effect time course of BASAGLAR may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and depends on many conditions, including the area of injection as well as the injection site blood supply and temperature.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The risk of hypoglycemia generally increases with intensity of glycemic control.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	BASAGLAR is contraindicated in patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to insulin glargine or one of the excipients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	All insulin products, including BASAGLAR, cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk for hypokalemia if indicated (e.g., patients using potassium-lowering medications, patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentrations).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients treated with insulin, including BASAGLAR, and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The primary activity of insulin, including insulin glargine, is regulation of glucose metabolism.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Insulin and its analog lower blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Insulin inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis, and enhances protein synthesis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The pharmacodynamic profile for BASAGLAR was determined after subcutaneous administration of a single 0.5 U/kg dose in a euglycemic clamp study conducted in 91 healthy subjects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The median time to maximum effect of BASAGLAR (measured by the peak rate of glucose infusion) was approximately 12.0 hours.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The pharmacodynamic profile of BASAGLAR following subcutaneous injection demonstrated sustained glucose lowering activity over 24 hours with no pronounced peak.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The mean area under the glucose infusion rate curves (measure of overall pharmacodynamic effect) and maximum glucose infusion rate were 1670 mg/kg and 2.12 mg/kg/min, respectively.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	WARNING: ASTHMA-RELATED DEATH Long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists (LABA), such as salmeterol, the active ingredient in SEREVENT DISKUS, as monotherapy (without inhaled corticosteroids [ICS]) increase the risk of asthma-related death.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Data from a large placebo-controlled U.S. trial that compared the safety of salmeterol with placebo added to usual asthma therapy showed an increase in asthma-related deaths in subjects receiving salmeterol (13 deaths out of 13,176 subjects treated for 28 weeks on salmeterol versus 3 deaths out of 13,179 subjects on placebo).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Use of background ICS was not required in this study.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When LABA are used in fixed-dose combination with ICS, data from large clinical trials do not show a significant increase in the risk of serious asthma-related events (hospitalizations, intubations, death) compared with ICS alone.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Use of SEREVENT DISKUS for the treatment of asthma as monotherapy without a concomitant ICS is contraindicated.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Use SEREVENT DISKUS only as additional therapy for patients with asthma who are currently taking but are inadequately controlled on an ICS.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Do not use SEREVENT DISKUS for patients whose asthma is adequately controlled on low- or medium-dose ICS.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Pediatric and Adolescent Patients Available data from controlled clinical trials suggest that LABA as monotherapy increase the risk of asthma-related hospitalization in pediatric and adolescent patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For pediatric and adolescent patients with asthma who require addition of a LABA to an ICS, a fixed-dose combination product containing both an ICS and a LABA should ordinarily be used to ensure adherence with both drugs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In cases where use of an ICS and a LABA is clinically indicated, appropriate steps must be taken to ensure adherence with both treatment components.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If adherence cannot be assured, a fixed-dose combination product containing both an ICS and a LABA is recommended.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	EIB: 1 inhalation at least 30 minutes before exercise.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Maintenance treatment of bronchospasm associated with COPD: 1 inhalation twice daily.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	LABA, such as salmeterol, the active ingredient in SEREVENT DISKUS, as monotherapy (without ICS) increase the risk of asthma-related death.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because of this risk, use of SEREVENT DISKUS for the treatment of asthma without concomitant use of an ICS is contraindicated.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For patients with asthma younger than 18 years who require addition of a LABA to an ICS, a fixed-dose combination product containing both an ICS and a LABA should ordinarily be used to ensure adherence with both drugs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In cases where use of a separate ICS and a LABA is clinically indicated, appropriate steps must be taken to ensure adherence with both treatment components.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For bronchodilatation and prevention of symptoms of asthma, including the symptoms of nocturnal asthma, the usual dosage for adults and children aged 4 years and older is 1 inhalation (50 mcg) twice daily, approximately 12 hours apart.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If a previously effective dosage regimen fails to provide the usual response, medical advice should be sought immediately as this is often a sign of destabilization of asthma.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Under these circumstances, the therapeutic regimen should be reevaluated.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If symptoms arise in the period between doses, an inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist should be taken for immediate relief.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Use of SEREVENT DISKUS as a single agent for the prevention of EIB may be clinically indicated in patients who do not have persistent asthma.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In patients with persistent asthma, use of SEREVENT DISKUS for the prevention of EIB may be clinically indicated, but the treatment of asthma should include an ICS.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	One inhalation of SEREVENT DISKUS at least 30 minutes before exercise has been shown to protect patients against EIB.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When used intermittently as needed for prevention of EIB, this protection may last up to 9 hours in adults and adolescents and up to 12 hours in patients aged 4 to 11 years.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Additional doses of SEREVENT should not be used for 12 hours after the administration of this drug.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	May block bronchodilatory effects of beta-agonists and produce severe bronchospasm.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Electrocardiographic changes and/or hypokalemia associated with non<U+2013>potassium-sparing diuretics may worsen with concomitant beta-agonists.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Salmeterol is a substrate of CYP3A4.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, ketoconazole, telithromycin) with SEREVENT DISKUS is not recommended because increased cardiovascular adverse effects may occur.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Three (3) subjects were withdrawn due to beta2-agonist side effects (2 with prolonged QTc and 1 with palpitations and sinus tachycardia).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Although there was no statistical effect on the mean QTc, coadministration of salmeterol and ketoconazole was associated with more frequent increases in QTc duration compared with salmeterol and placebo administration.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	SEREVENT DISKUS should be administered with extreme caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants, or within 2 weeks of discontinuation of such agents, because the action of salmeterol on the vascular system may be potentiated by these agents.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Beta-blockers not only block the pulmonary effect of beta-agonists, such as salmeterol, but may also produce severe bronchospasm in patients with asthma or COPD.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, patients with asthma or COPD should not normally be treated with beta-blockers.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, under certain circumstances, there may be no acceptable alternatives to the use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents for these patients; cardioselective beta-blockers could be considered, although they should be administered with caution.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The ECG changes and/or hypokalemia that may result from the administration of non<U+2013>potassium-sparing diuretics (such as loop or thiazide diuretics) can be acutely worsened by beta-agonists, especially when the recommended dose of the beta-agonist is exceeded.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Although the clinical significance of these effects is not known, caution is advised in the coadministration of SEREVENT DISKUS with non<U+2013>potassium-sparing diuretics.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	LABA as monotherapy (without ICS) for asthma increase the risk of asthma-related death and asthma-related hospitalizations.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Prescribe for asthma only as concomitant therapy with an inhaled corticosteroid.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Do not initiate in acutely deteriorating asthma or COPD.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Not a substitute for corticosteroids.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients with asthma must take a concomitant ICS.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Do not use in combination with an additional medicine containing a LABA because of risk of overdose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, discontinue SEREVENT DISKUS and institute alternative therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular or central nervous system disorders because of beta-adrenergic stimulation.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Use with caution in patients with convulsive disorders, thyrotoxicosis, diabetes mellitus, and ketoacidosis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Be alert to hypokalemia and hyperglycemia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When LABA are used in fixed<U+2011>dose combination with ICS, data from large clinical trials do not show a significant increase in the risk of serious asthma-related events (hospitalizations, intubations, death) compared with ICS alone.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The Salmeterol Multicenter Asthma Research Trial (SMART) was a large 28-week placebo-controlled U.S. trial comparing the safety of salmeterol (SEREVENT Inhalation Aerosol) with placebo, each added to usual asthma therapy, that showed an increase in asthma-related deaths in subjects receiving salmeterol.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Given the similar basic mechanisms of action of beta2-agonists, the findings seen in the SMART trial are considered a class effect.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A 16-week clinical trial performed in the United Kingdom, the Salmeterol Nationwide Surveillance (SNS) trial, showed results similar to the SMART trial.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In the SNS trial, the rate of asthma-related death was numerically, though not statistically significantly, greater in subjects with asthma treated with salmeterol (42 mcg twice daily) than those treated with albuterol (180 mcg 4 times daily) added to usual asthma therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The SNS and SMART trials enrolled subjects with asthma.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Available data do not suggest an increased risk of death with use of LABA in patients with COPD.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	SEREVENT DISKUS should not be initiated in patients during rapidly deteriorating or potentially life-threatening episodes of asthma or COPD.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	SEREVENT DISKUS has not been studied in subjects with acutely deteriorating asthma or COPD.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The initiation of SEREVENT DISKUS in this setting is not appropriate.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Serious acute respiratory events, including fatalities, have been reported when salmeterol has been initiated in patients with significantly worsening or acutely deteriorating asthma.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In most cases, these have occurred in patients with severe asthma (e.g., patients with a history of corticosteroid dependence, low pulmonary function, intubation, mechanical ventilation, frequent hospitalizations, previous life-threatening acute asthma exacerbations) and in some patients with acutely deteriorating asthma (e.g., patients with significantly increasing symptoms; increasing need for inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonists; decreasing response to usual medications; increasing need for systemic corticosteroids; recent emergency room visits; deteriorating lung function).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, these events have occurred in a few patients with less severe asthma as well.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It was not possible from these reports to determine whether salmeterol contributed to these events.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Increasing use of inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonists is a marker of deteriorating asthma.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In this situation, the patient requires immediate reevaluation with reassessment of the treatment regimen, giving special consideration to the possible need for adding additional ICS or initiating systemic corticosteroids.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients should not use more than 1 inhalation twice daily of SEREVENT DISKUS.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	SEREVENT DISKUS should not be used for the relief of acute symptoms, i.e., as rescue therapy for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist, not SEREVENT DISKUS, should be used to relieve acute symptoms such as shortness of breath.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When prescribing SEREVENT DISKUS, the healthcare provider should also prescribe an inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist (e.g., albuterol) for treatment of acute symptoms.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When beginning treatment with SEREVENT DISKUS, patients who have been taking oral or inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonists on a regular basis (e.g., 4 times a day) should be instructed to discontinue the regular use of these drugs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There are no data demonstrating that SEREVENT DISKUS has a clinical anti-inflammatory effect such as that associated with corticosteroids.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When initiating and throughout treatment with SEREVENT DISKUS in patients receiving oral or ICS for treatment of asthma, patients must continue taking a suitable dosage of corticosteroids to maintain clinical stability even if they feel better as a result of initiating SEREVENT DISKUS.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Any change in corticosteroid dosage should be made ONLY after clinical evaluation.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	SEREVENT DISKUS should not be used more often than recommended, at higher doses than recommended, or in conjunction with other medicines containing LABA, as an overdose may result.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Clinically significant cardiovascular effects and fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients using SEREVENT DISKUS should not use another medicine containing a LABA (e.g., formoterol fumarate, arformoterol tartrate, indacaterol) for any reason.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	As with other inhaled medicines, SEREVENT DISKUS can produce paradoxical bronchospasm, which may be life threatening.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs following dosing with SEREVENT DISKUS, it should be treated immediately with an inhaled, short-acting bronchodilator; SEREVENT DISKUS should be discontinued immediately; and alternative therapy should be instituted.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Upper airway symptoms of laryngeal spasm, irritation, or swelling, such as stridor and choking, have been reported in patients receiving SEREVENT DISKUS.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Excessive beta-adrenergic stimulation has been associated with seizures, angina, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia with rates up to 200 beats/min, arrhythmias, nervousness, headache, tremor, palpitation, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, malaise, and insomnia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, SEREVENT DISKUS, like all products containing sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Salmeterol can produce a clinically significant cardiovascular effect in some patients as measured by pulse rate, blood pressure, and/or symptoms.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Although such effects are uncommon after administration of salmeterol at recommended doses, if they occur, the drug may need to be discontinued.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In addition, beta-agonists have been reported to produce electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, such as flattening of the T wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST segment depression.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The clinical significance of these findings is unknown.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Large doses of inhaled or oral salmeterol (12 to 20 times the recommended dose) have been associated with clinically significant prolongation of the QTc interval, which has the potential for producing ventricular arrhythmias.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Immediate hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, rash, bronchospasm, hypotension), including anaphylaxis, may occur after administration of SEREVENT DISKUS.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There have been reports of anaphylactic reactions in patients with severe milk protein allergy after inhalation of powder products containing lactose; therefore, patients with severe milk protein allergy should not use SEREVENT DISKUS.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The use of strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, ketoconazole, telithromycin) with SEREVENT DISKUS is not recommended because increased cardiovascular adverse effects may occur.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	SEREVENT DISKUS, like all medicines containing sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with convulsive disorders or thyrotoxicosis and in those who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Doses of the related beta2-adrenoceptor agonist albuterol, when administered intravenously, have been reported to aggravate preexisting diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Beta-adrenergic agonist medicines may produce significant hypokalemia in some patients, possibly through intracellular shunting, which has the potential to produce adverse cardiovascular effects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The decrease in serum potassium is usually transient, not requiring supplementation.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Clinically significant and dose-related changes in blood glucose and/or serum potassium were seen infrequently during clinical trials with SEREVENT DISKUS at recommended doses.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In vitro studies show salmeterol to be at least 50 times more selective for beta2-adrenoceptors than albuterol.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Although beta2-adrenoceptors are the predominant adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscle and beta1-adrenoceptors are the predominant receptors in the heart, there are also beta2-adrenoceptors in the human heart comprising 10% to 50% of the total beta-adrenoceptors.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The precise function of these receptors has not been established, but their presence raises the possibility that even selective beta2-agonists may have cardiac effects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The pharmacologic effects of beta2-adrenoceptor agonist drugs, including salmeterol, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3<U+2032>,5<U+2032>-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In vitro tests show that salmeterol is a potent and long-lasting inhibitor of the release of mast cell mediators, such as histamine, leukotrienes, and prostaglandin D2, from human lung.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Salmeterol inhibits histamine-induced plasma protein extravasation and inhibits platelet-activating factor<U+2013>induced eosinophil accumulation in the lungs of guinea pigs when administered by the inhaled route.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In humans, single doses of salmeterol administered via inhalation aerosol attenuate allergen-induced bronchial hyper-responsiveness.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Inhaled salmeterol, like other beta-adrenergic agonist drugs, can produce dose-related cardiovascular effects and effects on blood glucose and/or serum potassium.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The cardiovascular effects (heart rate, blood pressure) associated with salmeterol inhalation aerosol occur with similar frequency, and are of similar type and severity, as those noted following albuterol administration.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effects of rising inhaled doses of salmeterol and standard inhaled doses of albuterol were studied in volunteers and in subjects with asthma.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Salmeterol doses up to 84 mcg administered as inhalation aerosol resulted in heart rate increases of 3 to 16 beats/min, about the same as albuterol dosed at 180 mcg by inhalation aerosol (4 to 10 beats/min).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Adult and adolescent subjects receiving 50-mcg doses of salmeterol inhalation powder (n = 60) underwent continuous electrocardiographic monitoring during two 12-hour periods after the first dose and after 1 month of therapy, and no clinically significant dysrhythmias were noted.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Also, pediatric patients receiving 50-mcg doses of salmeterol inhalation powder (n = 67) underwent continuous electrocardiographic monitoring during two 12-hour periods after the first dose and after 3 months of therapy, and no clinically significant dysrhythmias were noted.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In 24-week clinical studies in patients with COPD, the incidence of clinically significant abnormalities on the predose ECGs at Weeks 12 and 24 in patients who received salmeterol 50 mcg was not different compared with placebo.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	No effect of treatment with salmeterol 50 mcg was observed on pulse rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure in a subset of patients with COPD who underwent 12-hour serial vital sign measurements after the first dose (n = 91) and after 12 weeks of therapy (n = 74).

5	No increase in frequency of cardiovascular events was observed among the 3 subjects who averaged 8 to 11 inhalations/day; however, the safety of concomitant use of more than 8 inhalations/day of short-acting beta2-agonist with SEREVENT DISKUS has not been established.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In 29 subjects who experienced worsening of asthma while receiving SEREVENT DISKUS during these trials, albuterol therapy administered via either nebulizer or inhalation aerosol (1 dose in most cases) led to improvement in FEV1 and no increase in occurrence of cardiovascular adverse events.

5	Cromoglycate: In clinical trials, inhaled cromolyn sodium did not alter the safety profile of salmeterol when administered concurrently.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Salmeterol xinafoate, an ionic salt, dissociates in solution so that the salmeterol and 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid (xinafoate) moieties are absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and eliminated independently.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Salmeterol acts locally in the lung; therefore, plasma levels do not predict therapeutic effect.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Absorption Because of the small therapeutic dose, systemic levels of salmeterol are low or undetectable after inhalation of recommended doses (50 mcg of salmeterol inhalation powder twice daily).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Following chronic administration of an inhaled dose of 50 mcg of salmeterol inhalation powder twice daily, salmeterol was detected in plasma within 5 to 45 minutes in 7 subjects with asthma; plasma concentrations were very low, with mean peak concentrations of 167 pg/mL at 20 minutes and no accumulation with repeated doses.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Distribution The percentage of salmeterol bound to human plasma proteins averages 96% in vitro over the concentration range of 8 to 7,722 ng of salmeterol base per milliliter, much higher concentrations than those achieved following therapeutic doses of salmeterol.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Metabolism Salmeterol base is extensively metabolized by hydroxylation, with subsequent elimination predominantly in the feces.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	No significant amount of unchanged salmeterol base was detected in either urine or feces.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An in vitro study using human liver microsomes showed that salmeterol is extensively metabolized to <U+03B1>-hydroxysalmeterol (aliphatic oxidation) by CYP3A4.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, essentially completely inhibited the formation of <U+03B1>-hydroxysalmeterol in vitro.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Elimination In 2 healthy adult subjects who received 1 mg of radiolabeled salmeterol (as salmeterol xinafoate) orally, approximately 25% and 60% of the radiolabeled salmeterol was eliminated in urine and feces, respectively, over a period of 7 days.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The terminal elimination half-life was about 5.5 hours (1 volunteer only).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The xinafoate moiety has no apparent pharmacologic activity.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Peak plasma salmeterol concentrations were increased by 1.4-fold (90% CI: 1.23, 1.68).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Three (3) out of 20 subjects (15%) were withdrawn from salmeterol and ketoconazole coadministration due to beta-agonist<U+2013>mediated systemic effects (2 with QTc prolongation and 1 with palpitations and sinus tachycardia).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Coadministration of salmeterol and ketoconazole did not result in a clinically significant effect on mean heart rate, mean blood potassium, or mean blood glucose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Erythromycin: In a repeat-dose trial in 13 healthy subjects, concomitant administration of erythromycin (a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor) and salmeterol inhalation aerosol resulted in a 40% increase in salmeterol Cmax at steady state (ratio with and without erythromycin 1.4 [90% CI: 0.96, 2.03], P = 0.12), a 3.6-beat/min increase in heart rate ([95% CI: 0.19, 7.03], P<0.04), a 5.8-msec increase in QTc interval ([95% CI: -6.14, 17.77], P = 0.34), and no change in plasma potassium.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Ketamine hydrochloride is contraindicated in those in whom a significant elevation of blood pressure would constitute a serious hazard and in those who have shown hypersensitivity to the drug.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Note: Barbiturates and KETALAR, being chemically incompatible because of precipitate formation, should not be injected from the same syringe.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If the KETALAR dose is augmented with diazepam, the two drugs must be given separately.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Do not mix KETALAR and diazepam in syringe or infusion flask.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For additional information on the use of diazepam, refer to the WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Sections of the diazepam insert.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	While vomiting has been reported following KETALAR administration, some airway protection may be afforded because of active laryngeal-pharyngeal reflexes.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, since aspiration may occur with KETALAR and since protective reflexes may also be diminished by supplementary anesthetics and muscle relaxants, the possibility of aspiration must be considered.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	KETALAR is recommended for use in the patient whose stomach is not empty when, in the judgment of the practitioner, the benefits of the drug outweigh the possible risks.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Atropine, scopolamine, or another drying agent should be given at an appropriate interval prior to induction.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because of rapid induction following the initial intravenous injection, the patient should be in a supported position during administration.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The onset of action of KETALAR is rapid; an intravenous dose of 2 mg/kg of body weight usually produces surgical anesthesia within 30 seconds after injection, with the anesthetic effect usually lasting five to ten minutes.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If a longer effect is desired, additional increments can be administered intravenously or intramuscularly to maintain anesthesia without producing significant cumulative effects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Intramuscular doses, in a range of 9 to 13 mg/kg usually produce surgical anesthesia within 3 to 4 minutes following injection, with the anesthetic effect usually lasting 12 to 25 minutes.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	As with other general anesthetic agents, the individual response to KETALAR is somewhat varied depending on the dose, route of administration, and age of patient, so that dosage recommendation cannot be absolutely fixed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The drug should be titrated against the patient's requirements.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In individuals with a history of chronic ketamine use for off-label indications, there have been case reports of genitourinary pain that may be related to the ketamine treatment, not the underlying condition.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Consider cessation of ketamine if genitourinary pain continues in the setting of other genitourinary symptoms.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Intravenous Route: The initial dose of KETALAR administered intravenously may range from 1 mg/kg to 4.5 mg/kg.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The average amount required to produce five to ten minutes of surgical anesthesia has been 2 mg/kg.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Alternatively, in adult patients an induction dose of 1 mg to 2 mg/kg intravenous ketamine at a rate of 0.5 mg/kg/min may be used for induction of anesthesia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In addition, diazepam in 2 mg to 5 mg doses, administered in a separate syringe over 60 seconds, may be used.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In most cases, 15 mg of intravenous diazepam or less will suffice.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The incidence of psychological manifestations during emergence, particularly dream-like observations and emergence delirium, may be reduced by this induction dosage program.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Note: The 100 mg/mL concentration of KETALAR should not be injected intravenously without proper dilution.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is recommended the drug be diluted with an equal volume of either Sterile Water for injection, USP, Normal Saline, or 5% Dextrose in Water.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rate of Administration: It is recommended that KETALAR be administered slowly (over a period of 60 seconds).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	More rapid administration may result in respiratory depression and enhanced pressor response.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Intramuscular Route: The initial dose of KETALAR administered intramuscularly may range from 6.5 to 13 mg/kg.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A dose of 10 mg/kg will usually produce 12 to 25 minutes of surgical anesthesia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The maintenance dose should be adjusted according to the patient's anesthetic needs and whether an additional anesthetic agent is employed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Increments of one-half to the full induction dose may be repeated as needed for maintenance of anesthesia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, it should be noted that purposeless and tonic-clonic movements of extremities may occur during the course of anesthesia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These movements do not imply a light plane and are not indicative of the need for additional doses of the anesthetic.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It should be recognized that the larger the total dose of KETALAR administered, the longer will be the time to complete recovery.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Adult patients induced with KETALAR augmented with intravenous diazepam may be maintained on KETALAR given by slow microdrip infusion technique at a dose of 0.1 to 0.5 mg/minute, augmented with diazepam 2 to 5 mg administered intravenously as needed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In many cases 20 mg or less of intravenous diazepam total for combined induction and maintenance will suffice.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, slightly more diazepam may be required depending on the nature and duration of the operation, physical status of the patient, and other factors.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The incidence of psychological manifestations during emergence, particularly dream-like observations and emergence delirium, may be reduced by this maintenance dosage program.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dilution: To prepare a dilute solution containing 1 mg of ketamine per mL, aseptically transfer 10 mL from a 50 mg per mL vial or 5 mL from a 100 mg per mL vial to 500 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP (Normal Saline) and mix well.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The resultant solution will contain 1 mg of ketamine per mL.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The fluid requirements of the patient and duration of anesthesia must be considered when selecting the appropriate dilution of KETALAR.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If fluid restriction is required, KETALAR can be added to a 250 mL infusion as described above to provide a KETALAR concentration of 2 mg/mL.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	KETALAR 10 mg/mL vials are not recommended for dilution.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	KETALAR is clinically compatible with the commonly used general and local anesthetic agents when an adequate respiratory exchange is maintained.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The regimen of a reduced dose of KETALAR supplemented with diazepam can be used to produce balanced anesthesia by combination with other agents such as nitrous oxide and oxygen.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Prolonged recovery time may occur if barbiturates and/or narcotics are used concurrently with KETALAR.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	KETALAR should be used by or under the direction of physicians experienced in administering general anesthetics and in maintenance of an airway and in the control of respiration.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because pharyngeal and laryngeal reflexes are usually active, KETALAR should not be used alone in surgery or diagnostic procedures of the pharynx, larynx, or bronchial tree.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Mechanical stimulation of the pharynx should be avoided, whenever possible, if KETALAR is used alone.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Muscle relaxants, with proper attention to respiration, may be required in both of these instances.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Resuscitative equipment should be ready for use.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The incidence of emergence reactions may be reduced if verbal and tactile stimulation of the patient is minimized during the recovery period.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This does not preclude the monitoring of vital signs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The intravenous dose should be administered over a period of 60 seconds.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	More rapid administration may result in respiratory depression or apnea and enhanced pressor response.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	In animal reproduction studies in rats developmental delays (hypoplasia of skeletal tissues) were noted at 0.3 times the human intramuscular dose of 10 mg/kg.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In rabbits, developmental delays and increased fetal resorptions were noted at 0.6 times the human dose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Published studies in pregnant primates demonstrate that the administration of anesthetic and sedation drugs that block NMDA receptors and/or potentiate GABA activity during the period of peak brain development increases neuronal apoptosis in the developing brain of the offspring when used for longer than 3 hours.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There are no data on pregnancy exposures in primates corresponding to periods prior to the third trimester in humans.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Since the safe use in pregnancy, including obstetrics (either vaginal or abdominal delivery), has not been established, such use is not recommended.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Animal Data Pregnant rats were treated intramuscularly with 20 mg/kg ketamine (0.3 times the human dose of 10 mg/kg IM based on body surface area) on either Gestation Days 6 to 10 or Gestation Days 11 to 15.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Ketamine treatment produced an increased incidence of hypoplastic skull, phalanges, and sternebrae in the pups.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Pregnant rabbits were treated intramuscularly with 20 mg/kg ketamine (0.6 times the human dose of 10 mg/kg IM based on body surface area) on either Gestation Days 6 to 10 or Gestation Days 11 to 15.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An increase in resorptions and skeletal hypoplasia of the fetuses were noted.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Additional pregnant rabbits were treated intramuscularly with a single dose 60 mg/kg (1.9 times the human dose of 10 mg/kg IM based on body surface area) on Gestation Day 6 only.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Skeletal hypoplasia was reported in the fetuses.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a study where pregnant rats were treated intramuscularly with 20 mg/kg ketamine (0.3 times the human dose of 10 mg/kg IM based on body surface area) from Gestation Day 18 to 21.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There was a slight increase in incidence of delayed parturition by one day in treated dams of this group.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	No adverse effects on the litters or pups were noted; however, learning and memory assessments were not completed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Three pregnant beagle dogs were treated intramuscularly with 25 mg/kg ketamine (1.3 times the human dose of 10 mg/kg IM based on body surface area) twice weekly for the three weeks of the first, second, and third trimesters of pregnancy, respectively, without the development of adverse effects in the pups.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a published study in primates, administration of an anesthetic dose of ketamine for 24 hours on Gestation Day 122 increased neuronal apoptosis in the developing brain of the fetus.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In other published studies, administration of either isoflurane or propofol for 5 hours on Gestation Day 120 resulted in increased neuronal and oligodendrocyte apoptosis in the developing brain of the offspring.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	With respect to brain development, this time period corresponds to the third trimester of gestation in the human.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The clinical significance of these findings is not clear; however, studies in juvenile animals suggest neuroapoptosis correlates with long-term cognitive deficits.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Risk of Drowsiness As appropriate, especially in cases where early discharge is possible, the duration of KETALAR and other drugs employed during the conduct of anesthesia should be considered.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The patients should be cautioned that driving an automobile, operating hazardous machinery or engaging in hazardous activities should not be undertaken for 24 hours or more (depending upon the dosage of KETALAR and consideration of other drugs employed) after anesthesia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effect of anesthetic and sedation drugs on early brain development Studies conducted in young animals and children suggest repeated or prolonged use of general anesthetic or sedation drugs in children younger than 3 years may have negative effects on their developing brains.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Discuss with parents and caregivers the benefits, risks, and timing and duration of surgery or procedures requiring anesthetic and sedation drugs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Clinical studies of ketamine hydrochloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 16 have not been established.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Published juvenile animal studies demonstrate that the administration of anesthetic and sedation drugs, such as KETALAR, that either block NMDA receptors or potentiate the activity of GABA during the period of rapid brain growth or synaptogenesis, results in widespread neuronal and oligodendrocyte cell loss in the developing brain and alterations in synaptic morphology and neurogenesis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Based on comparisons across species, the window of vulnerability to these changes is believed to correlate with exposures in the third trimester of gestation through the first several months of life, but may extend out to approximately 3 years of age in humans.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In primates, exposure to 3 hours of ketamine that produced a light surgical plane of anesthesia did not increase neuronal cell loss, however, treatment regimens of 5 hours or longer of isoflurane increased neuronal cell loss.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Data from isoflurane-treated rodents and ketamine-treated primates suggest that the neuronal and oligodendrocyte cell losses are associated with prolonged cognitive deficits in learning and memory.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The clinical significance of these nonclinical findings is not known, and healthcare providers should balance the benefits of appropriate anesthesia in pregnant women, neonates, and young children who require procedures with the potential risks suggested by the nonclinical data.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cardiac function should be continually monitored during the procedure in patients found to have hypertension or cardiac decompensation.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Respiratory depression may occur with overdosage or too rapid a rate of administration of KETALAR, in which case supportive ventilation should be employed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Mechanical support of respiration is preferred to administration of analeptics.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Published animal studies demonstrate that the administration of anesthetic and sedation drugs that block NMDA receptors and/or potentiate GABA activity increase neuronal apoptosis in the developing brain and result in long-term cognitive deficits when used for longer than 3 hours.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The clinical significance of these findings is not clear.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, based on the available data, the window of vulnerability to these changes is believed to correlate with exposures in the third trimester of gestation through the first several months of life, but may extend out to approximately three years of age in humans.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Some published studies in children suggest that similar deficits may occur after repeated or prolonged exposures to anesthetic agents early in life and may result in adverse cognitive or behavioral effects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These studies have substantial limitations, and it is not clear if the observed effects are due to the anesthetic/sedation drug administration or other factors such as the surgery or underlying illness.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Anesthetic and sedation drugs are a necessary part of the care of children needing surgery, other procedures, or tests that cannot be delayed, and no specific medications have been shown to be safer than any other.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Decisions regarding the timing of any elective procedures requiring anesthesia should take into consideration the benefits of the procedure weighed against the potential risks.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	KETALAR is a rapid-acting general anesthetic producing an anesthetic state characterized by profound analgesia, normal pharyngeal-laryngeal reflexes, normal or slightly enhanced skeletal muscle tone, cardiovascular and respiratory stimulation, and occasionally a transient and minimal respiratory depression.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The mechanism of action is primarily due to antagonism of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA receptors) in the central nervous system.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A patent airway is maintained partly by virtue of unimpaired pharyngeal and laryngeal reflexes.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The biotransformation of KETALAR includes N-dealkylation (metabolite I), hydroxylation of the cyclohexone ring (metabolites III and IV), conjugation with glucuronic acid and dehydration of the hydroxylated metabolites to form the cyclohexene derivative (metabolite II).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Following intravenous administration, the ketamine concentration has an initial slope (alpha phase) lasting about 45 minutes with a half-life of 10 to 15 minutes.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This first phase corresponds clinically to the anesthetic effect of the drug.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The anesthetic action is terminated by a combination of redistribution from the CNS to slower equilibrating peripheral tissues and by hepatic biotransformation to metabolite I.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This metabolite is about 1/3 as active as ketamine in reducing halothane requirements (MAC) of the rat.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The later half-life of ketamine (beta phase) is 2.5 hours.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The anesthetic state produced by KETALAR has been termed dissociative anesthesia in that it appears to selectively interrupt association pathways of the brain before producing somatesthetic sensory blockade.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It may selectively depress the thalamoneocortical system before significantly obtunding the more ancient cerebral centers and pathways (reticular-activating and limbic systems).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Elevation of blood pressure begins shortly after injection, reaches a maximum within a few minutes and usually returns to preanesthetic values within 15 minutes after injection.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In the majority of cases, the systolic and diastolic blood pressure peaks from 10% to 50% above preanesthetic levels shortly after induction of anesthesia, but the elevation can be higher or longer in individual cases.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	ASMANEX HFA 200 mcg, 2 inhalations twice daily If a dosage regimen of ASMANEX HFA fails to provide adequate control of asthma, the therapeutic regimen should be re-evaluated and additional therapeutic options, e.g., replacing the current strength of ASMANEX HFA with a higher strength, initiating an inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta2-agonist combination product, or initiating oral corticosteroids, should be considered.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The maximum daily recommended dose is two inhalations of ASMANEX HFA 200 mcg twice daily (maximum of 800 mcg a day).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	The maximum benefit may not be achieved for 1 week or longer after beginning treatment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Individual patients may experience a variable time to onset and degree of symptom relief.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For patients who do not respond adequately after 2 weeks of therapy, higher strength may provide additional asthma control.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	After asthma stability has been achieved, it is desirable to titrate to the lowest effective dosage to reduce the possibility of side effects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir): Use with caution.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	May cause increased systemic corticosteroid effects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The main route of metabolism of corticosteroids, including mometasone furoate, is via CYP3A4.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors may inhibit the metabolism of, and increase the systemic exposure to, mometasone furoate and potentially increase the risk for systemic corticosteroid side effects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Caution should be exercised when considering the coadministration of ASMANEX HFA with long-term ketoconazole and other known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, cobicistat-containing products, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Consider the benefit of coadministration versus the potential risk of systemic corticosteroid effects, in which case patients should be monitored for systemic corticosteroid side effects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Deterioration of asthma and acute episodes: ASMANEX HFA should not be used for relief of acute symptoms.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Glaucoma and cataracts: Consider referral to an ophthalmologist in patients who develop ocular symptoms or use ASMANEX HFA long term.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	ASMANEX HFA is not indicated for the relief of acute symptoms, i.e., as rescue therapy for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist, not ASMANEX HFA, should be used to relieve acute symptoms such as shortness of breath.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When prescribing ASMANEX HFA, the physician must also provide the patient with an inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist (e.g., albuterol) for treatment of acute symptoms, despite regular twice-daily (morning and evening) use of ASMANEX HFA.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Instruct patients to contact their physician immediately if episodes of asthma that are not responsive to bronchodilators occur during the course of treatment with ASMANEX HFA.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During such episodes, patients may require therapy with oral corticosteroids.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In clinical trials, the development of localized infections of the mouth and pharynx with Candida albicans have occurred in patients treated with ASMANEX HFA.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Advise patients to rinse the mouth after inhalation of ASMANEX HFA.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Persons who are using drugs that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible children or adults using corticosteroids.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In such children or adults who have not had these diseases or who are not properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	How the dose, route, and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) or pooled intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) may be indicated.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Inhaled corticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculosis infection of the respiratory tract, untreated systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Particular care is needed for patients who are transferred from systemically active corticosteroids to ASMANEX HFA because deaths due to adrenal insufficiency have occurred in asthmatic patients during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids to less systemically available inhaled corticosteroids.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	After withdrawal from systemic corticosteroids, a number of months are required for recovery of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients who have been previously maintained on 20 mg or more per day of prednisone (or its equivalent) may be most susceptible, particularly when their systemic corticosteroids have been almost completely withdrawn.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During this period of HPA suppression, patients may exhibit signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency when exposed to trauma, surgery, or infection (particularly gastroenteritis) or other conditions associated with severe electrolyte loss.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Although ASMANEX HFA may improve control of asthma symptoms during these episodes, in recommended doses it supplies less than normal physiological amounts of corticosteroid systemically and does NOT provide the mineralocorticoid activity necessary for coping with these emergencies.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During periods of stress or severe asthma attack, patients who have been withdrawn from systemic corticosteroids should be instructed to resume oral corticosteroids (in large doses) immediately and to contact their physicians for further instruction.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These patients should also be instructed to carry a medical identification card indicating that they may need supplementary systemic corticosteroids during periods of stress or severe asthma attack.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients requiring oral or other systemic corticosteroids should be weaned slowly from oral or other systemic corticosteroid use after transferring to ASMANEX HFA.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lung function (FEV1 or PEF), beta-agonist use, and asthma symptoms should be carefully monitored during withdrawal of oral or other systemic corticosteroids.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In addition to monitoring asthma signs and symptoms, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency such as fatigue, lassitude, weakness, nausea and vomiting, and hypotension.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Transfer of patients from systemic corticosteroid therapy to ASMANEX HFA may unmask allergic conditions previously suppressed by the systemic corticosteroid therapy, e.g., rhinitis, conjunctivitis, eczema, arthritis, and eosinophilic conditions.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During withdrawal from oral corticosteroids, some patients may experience symptoms of systemically active corticosteroid withdrawal, e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude, and depression, despite maintenance or even improvement of respiratory function.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	ASMANEX HFA will often help control asthma symptoms with less suppression of HPA function than therapeutically equivalent oral doses of prednisone.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Since mometasone furoate is absorbed into the circulation and can be systemically active at higher doses, the beneficial effects of ASMANEX HFA in minimizing HPA dysfunction may be expected only when recommended dosages are not exceeded and individual patients are titrated to the lowest effective dose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because of the possibility of systemic absorption of inhaled corticosteroids, patients treated with ASMANEX HFA should be observed carefully for any evidence of systemic corticosteroid effects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Particular care should be taken in observing patients postoperatively or during periods of stress for evidence of inadequate adrenal response.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is possible that systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression (including adrenal crisis) may appear in a small number of patients, particularly when mometasone furoate is administered at higher than recommended doses over prolonged periods of time.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If such effects occur, the dosage of ASMANEX HFA should be reduced slowly, consistent with accepted procedures for reducing systemic corticosteroids and for management of asthma symptoms.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	ASMANEX HFA may produce inhalation induced bronchospasm with an immediate increase in wheezing after dosing that may be life-threatening.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If inhalation induced bronchospasm occurs, it should be treated immediately with an inhaled, short-acting bronchodilator.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	ASMANEX HFA should be discontinued immediately and alternative therapy instituted.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hypersensitivity reactions such as urticaria, flushing, allergic dermatitis, and bronchospasm, may occur after administration of ASMANEX HFA.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The following additional hypersensitivity reactions, such as rash, pruritus, angioedema, and anaphylactic reaction, have been reported after administration of mometasone furoate dry powder inhaler.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) have been observed with long-term administration of products containing inhaled corticosteroids, including mometasone furoate.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The clinical significance of small changes in BMD with regard to long-term outcomes, such as fracture, is unknown.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients with major risk factors for decreased bone mineral content, such as prolonged immobilization, family history of osteoporosis, or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass (e.g., anticonvulsants and corticosteroids) should be monitored and treated with established standards of care.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a 2-year double-blind study in 103 male and female asthma patients 18 to 50 years of age previously maintained on bronchodilator therapy (Baseline FEV1 85%-88% predicted), treatment with mometasone furoate dry powder inhaler 200 mcg twice daily resulted in significant reductions in lumbar spine (LS) BMD at the end of the treatment period compared to placebo.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The mean change from Baseline to Endpoint in the lumbar spine BMD was -0.015 (-1.43%) for the mometasone furoate dry powder inhaler group compared to 0.002 (0.25%) for the placebo group.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In another 2-year double-blind study in 87 male and female asthma patients 18 to 50 years of age previously maintained on bronchodilator therapy (Baseline FEV1 82%-83% predicted), treatment with mometasone furoate dry powder inhaler 400 mcg twice daily demonstrated no statistically significant changes in lumbar spine BMD at the end of the treatment period compared to placebo.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The mean change from Baseline to Endpoint in the lumbar spine BMD was -0.018 (-1.57%) for the mometasone furoate group compared to -0.006 (-0.43%) for the placebo group.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Orally inhaled corticosteroids, including ASMANEX HFA, may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Monitor the growth of pediatric patients receiving ASMANEX HFA routinely (e.g., via stadiometry).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of inhibitory effects on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in inflammation and in the asthmatic response.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids may contribute to their efficacy in asthma.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Mometasone furoate has been shown in vitro to exhibit a binding affinity for the human glucocorticoid receptor, which is approximately 12 times that of dexamethasone, 7 times that of triamcinolone acetonide, 5 times that of budesonide, and 1.5 times that of fluticasone.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The clinical significance of these findings is unknown.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	HPA Axis Effects The effects of inhaled mometasone furoate administered via ASMANEX HFA on adrenal function have not been directly evaluated.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, the effects of inhaled mometasone furoate, administered as part of a mometasone furoate/formoterol fumarate inhalation aerosol combination product, on adrenal function were evaluated in two clinical trials in patients with asthma.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	As no evidence of a pharmacokinetic drug interaction between mometasone furoate and formoterol was observed when the two drugs were administered in combination, the HPA axis effects from the combination product are applicable to ASMANEX HFA.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For the mometasone furoate/formoterol fumarate combination product clinical program, HPA-axis function was assessed by 24-hour plasma cortisol AUC.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Although both these trials have open-label design and contain a small number of subjects per treatment arm, results from these trials taken together demonstrated suppression of 24-hour plasma cortisol AUC for the combination mometasone furoate/formoterol fumarate 200 mcg/5 mcg compared to placebo consistent with the known systemic effects of inhaled corticosteroid.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a 42-day, open-label, placebo- and active-controlled study, the mean change from baseline plasma cortisol AUC(0-24 hr) was 8%, 22% and 34% lower compared to placebo for the mometasone furoate/formoterol fumarate 100 mcg/5 mcg (n=13), mometasone furoate/formoterol fumarate 200 mcg/5 mcg (n=15) and fluticasone propionate/salmeterol xinafoate 230 mcg/21 mcg (n=16) treatment groups, respectively.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a 52-week, open-label safety study, the mean plasma cortisol AUC(0-24 hr) was 2.2%, 29.6%, 16.7%, and 32.2% lower from baseline for the mometasone furoate/formoterol fumarate 100 mcg/5 mcg (n=18), mometasone furoate/formoterol fumarate 200 mcg/5 mcg (n=20), fluticasone propionate/salmeterol xinafoate 125/25 mcg (n=8), and fluticasone propionate/salmeterol xinafoate 250/25 mcg (n=11) treatment groups, respectively.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The potential effect of mometasone furoate via a dry powder inhaler (DPI) on the HPA axis was also assessed in a 29-day study.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A total of 64 adult patients with mild to moderate asthma were randomized to one of 4 treatment groups: mometasone furoate DPI 440 mcg twice daily, mometasone furoate DPI 880 mcg twice daily, oral prednisone 10 mg once daily, or placebo.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The 30-minute post-Cosyntropin stimulation serum cortisol concentration on Day 29 was 23.2 mcg/dL for the mometasone furoate DPI 440 mcg twice daily group and 20.8 mcg/dL for the mometasone furoate DPI 880 mcg twice daily group, compared to 14.5 mcg/dL for the oral prednisone 10 mg group and 25 mcg/dL for the placebo group.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The difference between mometasone furoate DPI 880 mcg twice daily (twice the maximum recommended dose) and placebo was statistically significant.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	As no evidence of a pharmacokinetic drug interaction between mometasone furoate and formoterol was observed when the two drugs were administered from a mometasone furoate/formoterol fumarate combination product, the pharmacokinetics information from the combination product is applicable to ASMANEX HFA.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Absorption Healthy Subjects: Following oral inhalation of single doses of ASMANEX HFA, mometasone furoate was absorbed in healthy subjects with median Tmax values ranging from 0.50 to 2 hours.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	During an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with CE plus MPA did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established CHD.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There were more CHD events in the CE plus MPA-treated group than in the placebo group in year 1, but not during the subsequent years.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Two thousand, three hundred and twenty-one (2,321) women from the original HERS trial agreed to participate in an open label extension of HERS, HERS II.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Average follow-up in HERS II was an additional 2.7 years, for a total of 6.8 years overall.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rates of CHD events were comparable among women in the CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) group and the placebo group in HERS, HERS II, and overall.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, the risk of VTE (DVT and PE), was increased for women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone compared to placebo (30 versus 22 per 10,000 women-years), although only the increased risk of DVT reached statistical significance (23 versus 15 per 10,000 women-years).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first 2 years3.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Should a VTE occur or be suspected, estrogen-alone therapy should be discontinued immediately.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant 2-fold greater rate of VTE was reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (35 versus 17 per 10,000 women-years).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Statistically significant increases in risk for both DVT (26 versus 13 per 10,000 women-years) and PE (18 versus 8 per 10,000 women-years) were also demonstrated.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first year and persisted4.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Should a VTE occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If feasible, estrogens should be discontinued at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Endometrial Cancer An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in a woman with a uterus.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 to 12 times greater than in non-users, and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with use of estrogens for less than 1 year.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The greatest risk appears associated with prolonged use, with increased risks of 15- to 24-fold for 5 to 10 years or more, and this risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Clinical surveillance of all women using estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy is important.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Adding a progestin to postmenopausal estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Breast Cancer The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about breast cancer in estrogen-alone users is the WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, after an average follow-up of 7.1 years, daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone was not associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer [relative risk (RR) 0.80] 5.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about breast cancer in estrogen plus progestin users is the WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	After a mean follow-up of 5.6 years, the estrogen plus progestin substudy reported an increased risk of invasive breast cancer in women who took daily CE plus MPA.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In this substudy, prior use of estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy was reported by 26 percent of the women.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.24, and the absolute risk was 41 versus 33 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo.6 Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.86, and the absolute risk was 46 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years for CE plus MPA compared with placebo.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.09, and the absolute risk was 40 versus 36 cases per 10,000 women-years for CE plus MPA compared with placebo.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In the same substudy, invasive breast cancers were larger, were more likely to be node positive, and were diagnosed at a more advanced stage in the CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) group compared with the placebo group.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Metastatic disease was rare, with no apparent difference between the two groups.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Other prognostic factors, such as histologic subtype, grade and hormone receptor status did not differ between the groups.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Consistent with the WHI clinical trial, observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy, and a smaller increased risk for estrogen-alone therapy, after several years of use.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The risk increased with duration of use, and appeared to return to baseline over about 5 years after stopping treatment (only the observational studies have substantial data on risk after stopping).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to estrogen-alone therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, these studies have not found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, doses, or routes of administration.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The use of estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms, requiring further evaluation.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Ovarian Cancer The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported a statistically non-significant increased risk of ovarian cancer.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	After an average follow-up of 5.6 years, the relative risk for ovarian cancer for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 1.58 (95 percent CI 0.77<U+2013>3.24).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The absolute risk for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 4 versus 3 cases per 10,000 women-years.7 A meta-analysis of 17 prospective and 35 retrospective epidemiology studies found that women who used hormonal therapy for menopausal symptoms had an increased risk for ovarian cancer.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The primary analysis, using case-control comparisons, included 12,110 cancer cases from the 17 prospective studies.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The relative risks associated with current use of hormonal therapy was 1.41 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32 to 1.50); there was no difference in the risk estimates by duration of the exposure (less than 5 years [median of 3 years] vs. greater than 5 years [median of 10 years] of use before the cancer diagnosis).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The relative risk associated with combined current and recent use (discontinued use within 5 years before cancer diagnosis) was 1.37 (95% CI 1.27<U+2013>1.48), and the elevated risk was significant for both estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin products.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The exact duration of hormone therapy use associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer, however, is unknown.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In the WHIMS estrogen-alone ancillary study of WHI, a population of 2,947 hysterectomized women 65 to 79 years of age was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone or placebo.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	After an average follow-up of 5.2 years, 28 women in the estrogen-alone group and 19 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The relative risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 1.49 (95 percent CI 0.83<U+2013>2.66).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 37 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years8.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In the WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of WHI, a population of 4,532 postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) or placebo.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	After an average follow-up of 4 years, 40 women in the CE plus MPA group and 21 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI 1.21<U+2013>3.48).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10,000 women-years8.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When data from the two populations in the WHIMS estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin ancillary studies were pooled as planned in the WHIMS protocol, the reported overall relative risk for probable dementia was 1.76 (95 percent CI 1.19<U+2013>2.60).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Since both ancillary studies were conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women8.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A 2- to 4-fold increase in the risk of gallbladder disease requiring surgery in postmenopausal women receiving estrogens has been reported.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Estrogen administration may lead to severe hypercalcemia in patients with breast cancer and bone metastases.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If hypercalcemia occurs, use of the drug should be stopped and appropriate measures taken to reduce the serum calcium level.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Retinal vascular thrombosis has been reported in patients receiving estrogens.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Discontinue medication pending examination if there is sudden partial or complete loss of vision, or a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia, or migraine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions, estrogens should be permanently discontinued.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cases of anaphylaxis, which developed within minutes to hours after taking PREMARIN and require emergency medical management, have been reported in the postmarketing setting.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Skin (hives, pruritis, swollen lips-tongue-face) and either respiratory tract (respiratory compromise) or gastrointestinal tract (abdominal pain, vomiting) involvement has been noted.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Angioedema involving the tongue, larynx, face, hands, and feet requiring medical intervention has occurred postmarketing in patients taking PREMARIN.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If angioedema involves the tongue, glottis, or larynx, airway obstruction may occur.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients who develop an anaphylactic reaction with or without angioedema after treatment with PREMARIN should not receive PREMARIN again.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogen-alone regimens.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These include an increased risk of breast cancer.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a small number of case reports, substantial increases in blood pressure have been attributed to idiosyncratic reactions to estrogens.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a large, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, a generalized effect of estrogen therapy on blood pressure was not seen.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Consider discontinuation of treatment if pancreatitis occurs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Estrogens may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For women with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised, and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Estrogen administration leads to increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Women with normal thyroid function can compensate for the increased TBG by making more thyroid hormone, thus maintaining free T4 and T3 serum concentrations in the normal range.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Women dependent on thyroid hormone replacement therapy who are also receiving estrogens may require increased doses of their thyroid replacement therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These women should have their thyroid function monitored in order to maintain their free thyroid hormone levels in an acceptable range.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Estrogens may cause some degree of fluid retention.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Women with conditions that might be influenced by this factor, such as cardiac or renal dysfunction, warrant careful observation when estrogen alone is prescribed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Estrogen therapy should be used with caution in individuals with hypoparathyroidism as estrogen-induced hypocalcemia may occur.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Exogenous estrogens may exacerbate symptoms of angioedema in women with hereditary angioedema.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A few cases of malignant transformation of residual endometrial implants have been reported in women treated post-hysterectomy with estrogen-alone therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For women known to have residual endometriosis post-hysterectomy, the addition of progestin should be considered.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Estrogen therapy may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine, porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol levels have not been shown to be useful in the management of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms and moderate to severe symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Laboratory parameters may be useful in guiding dosage for the treatment of hypoestrogenism due to hypogonadism, castration and primary ovarian failure.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol, at the receptor level.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone in the peripheral tissues.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thus, estrone and the sulfate-conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive tissues.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	To date, two estrogen receptors have been identified.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and FSH, through a negative feedback mechanism.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these gonadotropins seen in postmenopausal women.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There are no pharmacodynamic data for PREMARIN.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Absorption Conjugated estrogens are water-soluble and are absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after release from the drug formulation.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The PREMARIN tablet releases conjugated estrogens slowly over several hours.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Table 2 summarizes the mean pharmacokinetic parameters for unconjugated and conjugated estrogens following administration of 1 <U+00C3><U+2014> 0.625 mg and 1 <U+00C3><U+2014> 1.25 mg tablets to healthy postmenopausal women.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food effect: The pharmacokinetics of PREMARIN 0.45 mg and 1.25 mg tablets were assessed following a single dose with a high-fat breakfast and with fasting administration.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The Cmax and AUC of estrogens were altered approximately 3<U+2013>13%.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The changes to Cmax and AUC are not considered clinically meaningful, therefore PREMARIN may be taken without regard to meals.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Estrogens are widely distributed in the body and are generally found in higher concentration in the sex hormone target organs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Estrogens circulate in the blood largely bound to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and albumin.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Metabolism Exogenous estrogens are metabolized in the same manner as endogenous estrogens.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These transformations take place mainly in the liver.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Estradiol is converted reversibly to estrone, and both can be converted to estriol, which is a major urinary metabolite.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Estrogens also undergo enterohepatic recirculation via sulfate and glucuronide conjugation in the liver, biliary secretion of conjugates into the intestine, and hydrolysis in the intestine followed by reabsorption.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In postmenopausal women, a significant portion of the circulating estrogens exists as sulfate conjugates, especially estrone sulfate, which serves as a circulating reservoir for the formation of more active estrogens.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Excretion Estradiol, estrone, and estriol are excreted in the urine, along with glucuronide and sulfate conjugates.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Use in Specific Populations No pharmacokinetic studies were conducted with Premarin in specific populations, including patients with renal or hepatic impairment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	PRECOSE is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Precose is contraindicated in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis or cirrhosis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	PRECOSE is also contraindicated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, colonic ulceration, partial intestinal obstruction or in patients predisposed to intestinal obstruction.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In addition, PRECOSE is contraindicated in patients who have chronic intestinal diseases associated with marked disorders of digestion or absorption and in patients who have conditions that may deteriorate as a result of increased gas formation in the intestine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There is no fixed dosage regimen for the management of diabetes mellitus with PRECOSE or any other pharmacologic agent.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dosage of PRECOSE must be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerance while not exceeding the maximum recommended dose of 100 mg t.i.d.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	PRECOSE should be taken three times daily at the start (with the first bite) of each main meal.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	PRECOSE should be started at a low dose, with gradual dose escalation as described below, both to reduce gastrointestinal side effects and to permit identification of the minimum dose required for adequate glycemic control of the patient.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If the prescribed diet is not observed, the intestinal side effects may be intensified.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If strongly distressing symptoms develop in spite of adherence to the diabetic diet prescribed, the doctor must be consulted and the dose temporarily or permanently reduced.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During treatment initiation and dose titration, one-hour postprandial plasma glucose may be used to determine the therapeutic response to PRECOSE and identify the minimum effective dose for the patient.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thereafter, glycosylated hemoglobin should be measured at intervals of approximately three months.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The therapeutic goal should be to decrease both postprandial plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels to normal or near normal by using the lowest effective dose of PRECOSE, either as monotherapy or in combination with sulfonylureas, insulin or metformin.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The recommended starting dosage of PRECOSE is 25 mg given orally three times daily at the start (with the first bite) of each main meal.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, some patients may benefit from more gradual dose titration to minimize gastrointestinal side effects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This may be achieved by initiating treatment at 25 mg once per day and subsequently increasing the frequency of administration to achieve 25 mg t.i.d.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Once a 25 mg t.i.d. dosage regimen is reached, dosage of PRECOSE should be adjusted at 4<U+2013>8 week intervals based on one-hour postprandial glucose or glycosylated hemoglobin levels, and on tolerance.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The dosage can be increased from 25 mg t.i.d. to 50 mg t.i.d.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Some patients may benefit from further increasing the dosage to 100 mg t.i.d.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The maintenance dose ranges from 50 mg t.i.d. to 100 mg t.i.d.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, since patients with low body weight may be at increased risk for elevated serum transaminases, only patients with body weight > 60 kg should be considered for dose titration above 50 mg t.i.d.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If no further reduction in postprandial glucose or glycosylated hemoglobin levels is observed with titration to 100 mg t.i.d., consideration should be given to lowering the dose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Once an effective and tolerated dosage is established, it should be maintained.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The maximum recommended dose for patients <U+2264> 60 kg is 50 mg t.i.d.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The maximum recommended dose for patients > 60 kg is 100 mg t.i.d.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Sulfonylurea agents or insulin may cause hypoglycemia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	PRECOSE given in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin will cause a further lowering of blood glucose and may increase the potential for hypoglycemia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If hypoglycemia occurs, appropriate adjustments in the dosage of these agents should be made.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of blood glucose control.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These drugs include the thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel-blocking drugs, and isoniazid.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving PRECOSE, the patient should be closely observed for loss of blood glucose control.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When such drugs are withdrawn from patients receiving PRECOSE in combination with sulfonylureas or insulin, patients should be observed closely for any evidence of hypoglycemia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients Receiving Sulfonylureas or Insulin: Sulfonylurea agents or insulin may cause hypoglycemia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	PRECOSE given in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin may cause a further lowering of blood glucose and may increase the potential for hypoglycemia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Very rarely, individual cases of hypoglycemic shock have been reported in patients receiving PRECOSE therapy in combination with sulfonylureas and/or insulin.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Intestinal adsorbents (for example, charcoal) and digestive enzyme preparations containing carbohydrate-splitting enzymes (for example, amylase, pancreatin) may reduce the effect of PRECOSE and should not be taken concomitantly.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	PRECOSE has been shown to change the bioavailability of digoxin when they are coadministered, which may require digoxin dose adjustment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	(See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Drug-Drug Interactions.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with PRECOSE or any other anti-diabetic drug.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hypoglycemia Because of its mechanism of action, PRECOSE when administered alone should not cause hypoglycemia in the fasted or postprandial state.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because PRECOSE given in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin will cause a further lowering of blood glucose, it may increase the potential for hypoglycemia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hypoglycemia does not occur in patients receiving metformin alone under usual circumstances of use, and no increased incidence of hypoglycemia was observed in patients when PRECOSE was added to metformin therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Oral glucose (dextrose), whose absorption is not inhibited by PRECOSE, should be used instead of sucrose (cane sugar) in the treatment of mild to moderate hypoglycemia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Sucrose, whose hydrolysis to glucose and fructose is inhibited by PRECOSE, is unsuitable for the rapid correction of hypoglycemia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Severe hypoglycemia may require the use of either intravenous glucose infusion or glucagon injection.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In long-term studies (up to 12 months, and including PRECOSE doses up to 300 mg t.i.d.) conducted in the United States, treatment-emergent elevations of serum transaminases (AST and/or ALT) above the upper limit of normal (ULN), greater than 1.8 times the ULN, and greater than 3 times the ULN occurred in 14%, 6%, and 3%, respectively, of PRECOSE-treated patients as compared to 7%, 2%, and 1%, respectively, of placebo-treated patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Although these differences between treatments were statistically significant, these elevations were asymptomatic, reversible, more common in females, and, in general, were not associated with other evidence of liver dysfunction.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In addition, these serum transaminase elevations appeared to be dose related.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In US studies including PRECOSE doses up to the maximum approved dose of 100 mg t.i.d., treatment-emergent elevations of AST and/or ALT at any level of severity were similar between PRECOSE-treated patients and placebo-treated patients (p <U+2265> 0.496).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In approximately 3 million patient-years of international postmarketing experience with PRECOSE, 62 cases of serum transaminase elevations > 500 IU/L (29 of which were associated with jaundice) have been reported.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Forty-one of these 62 patients received treatment with 100 mg t.i.d. or greater and 33 of 45 patients for whom weight was reported weighed < 60 kg.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In the 59 cases where follow-up was recorded, hepatic abnormalities improved or resolved upon discontinuation of PRECOSE in 55 and were unchanged in two.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cases of fulminant hepatitis with fatal outcome have been reported; the relationship to acarbose is unclear.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When diabetic patients are exposed to stress such as fever, trauma, infection, or surgery, a temporary loss of control of blood glucose may occur.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	At such times, temporary insulin therapy may be necessary.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients should be told to take PRECOSE orally three times a day at the start (with the first bite) of each main meal.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is important that patients continue to adhere to dietary instructions, a regular exercise program, and regular testing of urine and/or blood glucose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	PRECOSE itself does not cause hypoglycemia even when administered to patients in the fasted state.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Sulfonylurea drugs and insulin, however, can lower blood sugar levels enough to cause symptoms or sometimes life-threatening hypoglycemia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because PRECOSE given in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin will cause a further lowering of blood sugar, it may increase the hypoglycemic potential of these agents.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The risk of hypoglycemia, its symptoms and treatment, and conditions that predispose to its development should be well understood by patients and responsible family members.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because PRECOSE prevents the breakdown of table sugar, patients should have a readily available source of glucose (dextrose, D-glucose) to treat symptoms of low blood sugar when taking PRECOSE in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If side effects occur with PRECOSE, they usually develop during the first few weeks of therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	They are most commonly mild-to-moderate gastrointestinal effects, such as flatulence, diarrhea, or abdominal discomfort, and generally diminish in frequency and intensity with time.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therapeutic response to PRECOSE should be monitored by periodic blood glucose tests.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Measurement of glycosylated hemoglobin levels is recommended for the monitoring of long-term glycemic control.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	PRECOSE, particularly at doses in excess of 50 mg t.i.d., may give rise to elevations of serum transaminases and, in rare instances, hyperbilirubinemia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is recommended that serum transaminase levels be checked every 3 months during the first year of treatment with PRECOSE and periodically thereafter.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If elevated transaminases are observed, a reduction in dosage or withdrawal of therapy may be indicated, particularly if the elevations persist.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Monitoring glycemic control with 1,5-AG assay is not recommended as measurements of 1,5-AG are unreliable in assessing glycemic control in patients taking acarbose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Use alternative methods to monitor for glycemic control.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Plasma concentrations of PRECOSE in renally impaired volunteers were proportionally increased relative to the degree of renal dysfunction.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Long-term clinical trials in diabetic patients with significant renal dysfunction (serum creatinine > 2.0 mg/dL) have not been conducted.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, treatment of these patients with PRECOSE is not recommended.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Eight carcinogenicity studies were conducted with acarbose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Six studies were performed in rats (two strains, Sprague-Dawley and Wistar) and two studies were performed in hamsters.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In the first rat study, Sprague-Dawley rats received acarbose in feed at high doses (up to approximately 500 mg/kg body weight) for 104 weeks.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Acarbose treatment resulted in a significant increase in the incidence of renal tumors (adenomas and adenocarcinomas) and benign Leydig cell tumors.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This study was repeated with a similar outcome.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Further studies were performed to separate direct carcinogenic effects of acarbose from indirect effects resulting from the carbohydrate malnutrition induced by the large doses of acarbose employed in the studies.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In one study using Sprague-Dawley rats, acarbose was mixed with feed but carbohydrate deprivation was prevented by the addition of glucose to the diet.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a 26-month study of Sprague-Dawley rats, acarbose was administered by daily postprandial gavage so as to avoid the pharmacologic effects of the drug.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In both of these studies, the increased incidence of renal tumors found in the original studies did not occur.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Acarbose was also given in food and by postprandial gavage in two separate studies in Wistar rats.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	No increased incidence of renal tumors was found in either of these Wistar rat studies.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In two feeding studies of hamsters, with and without glucose supplementation, there was also no evidence of carcinogenicity.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Acarbose did not induce any DNA damage in vitro in the CHO chromosomal aberration assay, bacterial mutagenesis (Ames) assay, or a DNA binding assay.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In vivo, no DNA damage was detected in the dominant lethal test in male mice, or the mouse micronucleus test.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Fertility studies conducted in rats after oral administration produced no untoward effect on fertility or on the overall capability to reproduce.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The safety of PRECOSE in pregnant women has not been established.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Reproduction studies have been performed in rats at doses up to 480 mg/kg (corresponding to 9 times the exposure in humans, based on drug blood levels) and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to acarbose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In rabbits, reduced maternal body weight gain, probably the result of the pharmacodynamic activity of high doses of acarbose in the intestines, may have been responsible for a slight increase in the number of embryonic losses.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, rabbits given 160 mg/kg acarbose (corresponding to 10 times the dose in man, based on body surface area) showed no evidence of embryotoxicity and there was no evidence of teratogenicity at a dose 32 times the dose in man (based on body surface area).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies of PRECOSE in pregnant women.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of the human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because current information strongly suggests that abnormal blood glucose levels during pregnancy are associated with a higher incidence of congenital anomalies as well as increased neonatal morbidity and mortality, most experts recommend that insulin be used during pregnancy to maintain blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A small amount of radioactivity has been found in the milk of lactating rats after administration of radiolabeled acarbose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, PRECOSE should not be administered to a nursing woman.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Safety and effectiveness of PRECOSE in pediatric patients have not been established.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of PRECOSE in the United States, 27% were 65 and over, while 4% were 75 and over.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The mean steady-state area under the curve (AUC) and maximum concentrations of acarbose were approximately 1.5 times higher in elderly compared to young volunteers; however, these differences were not statistically significant.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Acarbose is a complex oligosaccharide that delays the digestion of ingested carbohydrates,thereby resulting in a smaller rise in blood glucose concentration following meals.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	As a consequence of plasma glucose reduction, PRECOSE reduces levels of glycosylated hemoglobin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Systemic non-enzymatic protein glycosylation, as reflected by levels of glycosylated hemoglobin, is a function of average blood glucose concentration over time.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In contrast to sulfonylureas, PRECOSE does not enhance insulin secretion.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The antihyperglycemic action of acarbose results from a competitive, reversible inhibition of pancreatic alpha-amylase and membrane-bound intestinal alpha-glucoside hydrolase enzymes.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Pancreatic alpha-amylase hydrolyzes complex starches to oligosaccharides in the lumen of the small intestine, while the membrane-bound intestinal alpha-glucosidases hydrolyze oligosaccharides, trisaccharides, and disaccharides to glucose and other monosaccharides in the brush border of the small intestine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In diabetic patients, this enzyme inhibition results in a delayed glucose absorption and a lowering of postprandial hyperglycemia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because its mechanism of action is different, the effect of PRECOSE to enhance glycemic control is additive to that of sulfonylureas, insulin or metformin when used in combination.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In addition, PRECOSE diminishes the insulinotropic and weight-increasing effects of sulfonylureas.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Acarbose has no inhibitory activity against lactase and consequently would not be expected to induce lactose intolerance.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a study of 6 healthy men, less than 2% of an oral dose of acarbose was absorbed as active drug, while approximately 35% of total radioactivity from a 14C-labeled oral dose was absorbed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An average of 51% of an oral dose was excreted in the feces as unabsorbed drug-related radioactivity within 96 hours of ingestion.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because acarbose acts locally within the gastrointestinal tract, this low systemic bioavailability of parent compound is therapeutically desired.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Following oral dosing of healthy volunteers with 14C-labeled acarbose, peak plasma concentrations of radioactivity were attained 14<U+2013>24 hours after dosing, while peak plasma concentrations of active drug were attained at approximately 1 hour.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The delayed absorption of acarbose-related radioactivity reflects the absorption of metabolites that may be formed by either intestinal bacteria or intestinal enzymatic hydrolysis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Acarbose is metabolized exclusively within the gastrointestinal tract, principally by intestinal bacteria, but also by digestive enzymes.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A fraction of these metabolites (approximately 34% of the dose) was absorbed and subsequently excreted in the urine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	At least 13 metabolites have been separated chromatographically from urine specimens.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The major metabolites have been identified as 4-methylpyrogallol derivatives (that is, sulfate, methyl, and glucuronide conjugates).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	One metabolite (formed by cleavage of a glucose molecule from acarbose) also has alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This metabolite, together with the parent compound, recovered from the urine, accounts for less than 2% of the total administered dose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The fraction of acarbose that is absorbed as intact drug is almost completely excreted by the kidneys.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When acarbose was given intravenously, 89% of the dose was recovered in the urine as active drug within 48 hours.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In contrast, less than 2% of an oral dose was recovered in the urine as active (that is, parent compound and active metabolite) drug.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This is consistent with the low bioavailability of the parent drug.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The plasma elimination half-life of acarbose activity is approximately 2 hours in healthy volunteers.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Consequently, drug accumulation does not occur with three times a day (t.i.d.)	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients with severe renal impairment (Clcr < 25 mL/min/1.73m2) attained about 5 times higher peak plasma concentrations of acarbose and 6 times larger AUCs than volunteers with normal renal function.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	No studies of acarbose pharmacokinetic parameters according to race have been performed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In U.S. controlled clinical studies of PRECOSE in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, reductions in glycosylated hemoglobin levels were similar in Caucasians (n=478) and African-Americans (n=167), with a trend toward a better response in Latinos (n=132).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Studies in healthy volunteers have shown that PRECOSE has no effect on either the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of nifedipine, propranolol, or ranitidine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	PRECOSE did not interfere with the absorption or disposition of the sulfonylurea glyburide in diabetic patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The amount of metformin absorbed while taking PRECOSE was bioequivalent to the amount absorbed when taking placebo, as indicated by the plasma AUC values.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There is little if any clinically significant interaction between PRECOSE and metformin.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	OSMOLEX ER is contraindicated in patients with end-stage renal disease (i.e., creatinine clearance below 15 mL/min/1.73 m2).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	OSMOLEX ER is contraindicated in patients with end-stage renal disease (4)	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The initial dosage is 129 mg orally once daily in the morning (2.1) The dosage may be increased in weekly intervals to a maximum daily dose of 322 mg once daily in the morning (2.1) Swallow tablets whole; do not chew, crush, or divide (2.2) Dosing frequency reduction and monitoring required for renal impairment (2.3, 8.6) The recommended initial dosage of OSMOLEX ER is 129 mg administered orally once daily in the morning.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The dosage may be increased in weekly intervals to a maximum daily dose of 322 mg (administered as a 129 mg and 193 mg tablet), taken in the morning.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	OSMOLEX ER is not interchangeable with other amantadine immediate- or extended-release products.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For patients unable to tolerate more than 100 mg per day of immediate-release amantadine, there is no equivalent dose or dosing regimen of OSMOLEX ER.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	OSMOLEX ER can be administered without regard to food.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There are no modifications for the recommended initial and maximum dosage in patients with renal impairment; however, modifications are recommended for the titration interval and frequency of dosing in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Table 1: Recommended Titration and Frequency of OSMOLEX ER Dosing in Patients with Renal Impairment Renal Function/Estimated GFR (mL/min/1.73 m2)* Minimum Titration Interval Frequency of Dosing Regimen Mild renal impairment (60 to 89) Increase every week One dose every 24 hours Moderate renal impairment (30 to 59) Increase every 3 weeks One dose every 48 hours Severe renal impairment (15 to 29) Increase every 4 weeks One dose every 96 hours End-Stage Renal Disease (below 15) Contraindicated * estimated by Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) method Monitor patients with renal impairment for change in renal function, especially in those with severe renal impairment receiving the maximum daily dosage of 322 mg.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	OSMOLEX ER should not be discontinued abruptly.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The dose should be reduced gradually from higher doses to 129 mg daily for 1 to 2 weeks before discontinuing.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If a dose of OSMOLEX ER is missed, the next dose should be taken as scheduled.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Anticholinergic Drugs: Increased risk of anticholinergic effects; the dose of anticholinergic drugs or OSMOLEX ER may require reduction (7.1) Drugs Affecting Urinary pH: Excretion increases with acidic urine; possible accumulation with urine change towards alkaline (7.2) Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccines: Not recommended during use (7.3) Alcohol: Concomitant use is not recommended; increased potential for CNS effects (7.4) Products with anticholinergic properties may potentiate the anticholinergic-like side effects of amantadine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The dose of anticholinergic drugs or of OSMOLEX ER should be reduced if atropine-like effects appear when these drugs are used concurrently.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The pH of the urine has been reported to influence the excretion rate of amantadine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Urine pH is altered by diet, drugs (e.g., carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, sodium bicarbonate), and clinical state of the patient (e.g., renal tubular acidosis or severe infections of the urinary tract).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Alterations of urine pH towards the alkaline condition may lead to an accumulation of the drug with a possible increase in adverse reactions.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Monitor for efficacy or adverse reactions under conditions that alter the urine pH to more acidic or alkaline, respectively.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because of its antiviral properties, amantadine may interfere with the efficacy of live attenuated influenza vaccines.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, live vaccines are not recommended during treatment with OSMOLEX ER.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Inactivated influenza vaccines may be used, as appropriate.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant use with alcohol is not recommended, as it may increase the potential for central nervous system effects such as somnolence, dizziness, confusion, lightheadedness, and orthostatic hypotension.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Falling Asleep During Activities of Daily Living and Somnolence: Advise patients prior to treatment; ordinarily discontinue if occurs (5.1) Suicidality and Depression: Monitor patients for depressed mood, depression, or suicidal ideation or behavior (5.2) Hallucinations/Psychotic Behavior: Patients with major psychotic disorder should ordinarily not be treated with OSMOLEX ER; observe patients for the occurrence of hallucinations throughout treatment, especially at initiation and after dose increases (5.3) Dizziness and Orthostatic Hypotension: Monitor patients for dizziness and orthostatic hypotension, especially after starting OSMOLEX ER or increasing the dose (5.4) Withdrawal-Emergent Hyperpyrexia and Confusion: Avoid sudden discontinuation (5.5) Impulse Control/Compulsive Behaviors: Ask patients about increased gambling urges, sexual urges, uncontrolled spending or other urges; consider dose reduction or discontinuation if occurs (5.6) Patients treated with amantadine have reported falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living, including the operation of motor vehicles, which sometimes has resulted in accidents.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients may not perceive warning signs, such as excessive drowsiness, or they may report feeling alert immediately prior to the event.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Before initiating treatment with OSMOLEX ER, advise patients of the potential to develop drowsiness and specifically ask about factors that may increase the risk for somnolence with OSMOLEX ER, such as concomitant sedating medications, alcohol, or the presence of a sleep disorder.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If a patient develops daytime sleepiness or episodes of falling asleep during activities that require full attention (e.g., driving a motor vehicle, conversations, eating), OSMOLEX ER should ordinarily be discontinued.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If a decision is made to continue OSMOLEX ER, advise patients not to drive and to avoid other potentially dangerous activities that might result in harm if they become somnolent.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There is insufficient information to establish that dose reduction will eliminate episodes of falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living or daytime somnolence.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Suicide, suicide attempts, and suicidal ideation have been reported in patients with and without prior history of psychiatric illness while treated with amantadine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Amantadine can exacerbate psychiatric symptoms in patients with a history of psychiatric disorders or substance abuse.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Monitor patients for depression, including suicidal ideation or behavior.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Prescribers should consider whether the benefits outweigh the risks of treatment with OSMOLEX ER in patients with a history of suicidality or depression.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients with a major psychotic disorder should ordinarily not be treated with OSMOLEX ER because of the risk of exacerbating psychosis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Treatment with amantadine or abrupt withdrawal can cause confusion, psychosis, personality changes, agitation, aggressive behavior, hallucinations, paranoia, other psychotic or paranoia reactions.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Monitor patients for hallucinations throughout treatment but especially after initiation and after the dose of OSMOLEX ER is increased or decreased.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dizziness and orthostatic hypotension can occur with OSMOLEX ER.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients should be monitored for these adverse reactions, especially after starting OSMOLEX ER or increasing the dose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant use of alcohol when using OSMOLEX ER is not recommended.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A symptom complex resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome (characterized by elevated temperature, muscular rigidity, altered consciousness, and autonomic instability), with no other obvious etiology, has been reported in association with rapid dose reduction, withdrawal of, or changes in drugs that increase central dopaminergic tone.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Abrupt discontinuation of OSMOLEX ER may cause an increase in the symptoms of Parkinson<U+2019>s disease or cause delirium, agitation, delusions, hallucinations, paranoid reaction, stupor, anxiety, depression, or slurred speech.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is recommended to avoid sudden discontinuation of OSMOLEX ER.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients can experience intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges, intense urges to spend money, binge eating, and/or other intense urges, and the inability to control these urges while taking one or more of the medications that increase central dopaminergic tone, including OSMOLEX ER.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In some cases, these urges were reported to have stopped when the dose was reduced or the medication was stopped.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal, it is important for prescribers to specifically ask patients or their caregivers about the development of new or increased gambling urges, sexual urges, uncontrolled spending, or other urges while being treated with OSMOLEX ER.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops such urges while taking OSMOLEX ER.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The mechanism by which amantadine exerts efficacy in the treatment of Parkinson<U+2019>s disease and drug-induced extrapyramidal reactions is unknown.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Amantadine is a weak uncompetitive antagonist of the NMDA receptor; however, it exhibits anticholinergic-like side effects such as dry mouth, urinary retention, and constipation in humans.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Amantadine may have direct and indirect effects on dopamine neurons; it exerts dopaminergic-like side effects such as hallucinations and dizziness in humans.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effect of amantadine on QT prolongation was not studied in a dedicated thorough QT study.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Alcohol consumption may increase the potential for CNS effects, such as somnolence, dizziness, confusion, lightheadedness, and orthostatic hypotension.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	OSMOLEX ER tablet consists of an immediate-release outer layer and an extended-release core.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The pharmacokinetics of amantadine from OSMOLEX ER is dose proportional across the dose range of 129 mg to 322 mg. Absorption Following oral administration of OSMOLEX ER, peak concentration of amantadine was observed in a median time of 7.5 hours (range 5.5 to 12 hours).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	After a single oral administration of the 129 mg dose, the mean (CV%) Cmax and AUC were 328 ng/ml (18%) and 8263 ng.h/ml (18%) respectively.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cmax and AUC with other dose levels of OSMOLEX ER increase proportionally.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effect of Food Food does not affect the rate or the extent of absorption of OSMOLEX ER.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Distribution Amantadine is 67% bound to plasma proteins over a concentration range of 0.1 to 2.0 <U+03BC>g/mL.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The volume of distribution after intravenous administration is 3-8 L/kg, suggesting potential extravascular distribution.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Elimination Amantadine is mainly eliminated renally, and approximately 85% of the administered dose is excreted unchanged in urine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	After oral administration of a single 129 mg OSMOLEX ER tablet, the apparent oral clearance was approximately11 L/h.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The half-life was approximately 16 hours.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Metabolism Metabolism accounts for only 5-15% of the total clearance for amantadine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Eight metabolites of amantadine have been identified in human urine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	One metabolite, an N-acetylated compound, was quantified in human urine and accounted for 0-15% of the administered dose in multiple studies.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The contribution of this metabolite to efficacy or toxicity is not known.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Excretion Amantadine is primarily excreted by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Amantadine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients with Renal Impairment The renal clearance of amantadine is significantly lower in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment, compared to healthy subjects with normal renal function.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, a reduction in dosing frequency is required for patients with moderate or severe renal impairment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Male and Female Patients In a study of young healthy subjects (n=20), mean renal clearance of amantadine, normalized for body mass index, was 1.5 fold higher in males compared to females.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	No dose adjustment by gender is warranted.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Peripheral neuropathy is a common (<U+2265>10%) and potentially severe adverse reaction of treatment with thalidomide that may be irreversible.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Peripheral neuropathy generally occurs following chronic use over a period of months; however, peripheral neuropathy following relatively short-term use has been reported.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The correlation with cumulative dose is unclear.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Symptoms may occur some time after thalidomide treatment has been stopped and may resolve slowly or not at all.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Few reports of neuropathy have arisen in the treatment of ENL despite long-term thalidomide treatment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, the inability clinically to differentiate thalidomide neuropathy from the neuropathy often seen in Hansen's disease makes it difficult to determine accurately the incidence of thalidomide-related neuropathy in ENL patients treated with thalidomide.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients should be examined at monthly intervals for the first 3 months of thalidomide therapy to enable the clinician to detect early signs of neuropathy, which include numbness, tingling or pain in the hands and feet.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients should be evaluated periodically thereafter during treatment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients should be regularly counseled, questioned, and evaluated for signs or symptoms of peripheral neuropathy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Consideration should be given to electrophysiological testing, consisting of measurement of sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) amplitudes at baseline and thereafter every 6 months in an effort to detect asymptomatic neuropathy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If symptoms of drug-induced neuropathy develop, thalidomide should be discontinued immediately to limit further damage, if clinically appropriate.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Usually, treatment with thalidomide should only be reinitiated if the neuropathy returns to baseline status.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Medications known to be associated with neuropathy should be used with caution in patients receiving thalidomide.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients should also be advised that thalidomide may cause dizziness and orthostatic hypotension and that, therefore, they should sit upright for a few minutes prior to standing up from a recumbent position.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Decreased white blood cell counts, including neutropenia, have been reported in association with the clinical use of thalidomide.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Treatment should not be initiated with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of <750/mm3.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	White blood cell count and differential should be monitored on an ongoing basis, especially in patients who may be more prone to neutropenia, such as patients who are HIV-seropositive.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If ANC decreases to below 750/mm3 while on treatment, the patient's medication regimen should be re-evaluated and, if the neutropenia persists, consideration should be given to withholding thalidomide if clinically appropriate.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thrombocytopenia, including Grade 3 or 4 occurrences, has been reported in association with the clinical use of thalidomide.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Monitor blood counts, including platelet counts.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of thalidomide in an HIV-seropositive patient population, plasma HIV RNA levels were found to increase (median change = 0.42 log10 copies HIV RNA/mL, p = 0.04 compared to placebo).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A similar trend was observed in a second, unpublished study conducted in patients who were HIV-seropositive.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The clinical significance of this increase is unknown.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Both studies were conducted prior to availability of highly active antiretroviral therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Until the clinical significance of this finding is further understood, in HIV-seropositive patients, viral load should be measured after the first and third months of treatment and every 3 months thereafter.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Bradycardia in association with thalidomide use has been reported.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cases of bradycardia have been reported, some required medical interventions.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Serious dermatologic reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, which may be fatal, have been reported.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	THALOMID should be discontinued if a skin rash occurs and only resumed following appropriate clinical evaluation.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If the rash is exfoliative, purpuric, or bullous or if Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis is suspected, use of THALOMID should not be resumed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Although not reported from pre-marketing controlled clinical trials, seizures, including grand mal convulsions, have been reported during post-approval use of THALOMID in clinical practice.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Most patients had disorders that may have predisposed them to seizure activity, and it is not currently known whether thalidomide has any epileptogenic influence.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During therapy with thalidomide, patients with a history of seizures or with other risk factors for the development of seizures should be monitored closely for clinical changes that could precipitate acute seizure activity.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Monitor patients at risk of tumor lysis syndrome (e.g., patients with high tumor burden prior to treatment) and take appropriate precautions.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Some contraceptive methods may pose a higher risk of adverse effects or may be medically contraindicated in some patients treated with THALOMID.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because some patients may develop sudden, severe neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia, use of an intrauterine device (IUD) or implantable contraception in these patients may carry an increased risk for infection or bleeding either at insertion, removal or during use.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Treatment with THALOMID, the presence of an underlying malignancy, and/or use of an estrogen-containing contraceptive can each increase the risk of thromboembolism.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is not known if these risks of thromboembolism are additive.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, they should be taken into consideration when choosing contraceptive methods.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hypersensitivity to THALOMID has been reported.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Signs and symptoms have included the occurrence of erythematous macular rash, possibly associated with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension, and if severe, may necessitate interruption of therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If the reaction recurs when dosing is resumed, THALOMID should be discontinued.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The mechanism of action of THALOMID is not fully understood.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cellular activities of thalidomide are mediated through its target cereblon, a component of a cullin ring E3 ubiquitin ligase enzyme complex.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	THALOMID possesses immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory and antiangiogenic properties.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Available data from in vitro studies and clinical trials suggest that the immunologic effects of this compound can vary substantially under different conditions, but may be related to suppression of excessive tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-<U+03B1>) production and down-modulation of selected cell surface adhesion molecules involved in leukocyte migration.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For example, administration of thalidomide has been reported to decrease circulating levels of TNF-<U+03B1> in patients with erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL); however, it has also been shown to increase plasma TNF-<U+03B1> levels in HIV-seropositive patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Other anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of thalidomide may include suppression of macrophage involvement in prostaglandin synthesis, and modulation of interleukin-10 and interleukin-12 production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thalidomide treatment of multiple myeloma patients is accompanied by an increase in the number of circulating natural killer cells, and an increase in plasma levels of interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma (T cell-derived cytokines associated with cytotoxic activity).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thalidomide was found to inhibit angiogenesis in a human umbilical artery explant model in vitro.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The cellular processes of angiogenesis inhibited by thalidomide may include the proliferation of endothelial cells.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Absorption Absorption of THALOMID is slow after oral administration.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The maximum plasma concentrations are reached approximately 2-5 hours after administration.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The absolute bioavailability of thalidomide from thalidomide capsules has not yet been characterized in human subjects due to its poor aqueous solubility.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Based on the 14C-radiolabel thalidomide study in human, greater than 90% of the total radioactivity is recovered in urine suggesting good oral absorption.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	While the extent of absorption (as measured by area under the curve [AUC]) is proportional to dose in healthy subjects, the observed peak concentration (Cmax) increased in a less than proportional manner.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This lack of Cmax dose proportionality, coupled with the observed increase in Tmax values, suggests that the poor solubility of thalidomide in aqueous media may be hindering the rate of absorption.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Distribution In human plasma, the geometric mean plasma protein binding was 55% and 66%, respectively, for (+)-(R)- and (-)-(S)-thalidomide.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a pharmacokinetic study of thalidomide in HIV-seropositive adult male subjects receiving thalidomide 100 mg/day, thalidomide was detectable in the semen.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Elimination The mean elimination half-life of thalidomide in plasma following single oral doses between 50 mg and 400 mg was 5.5 to 7.3 hours.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Following a single 400 mg oral dose of radiolabeled thalidomide, the total mean recovery was 93.6% of the administered dose by Day 8.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The majority of the radioactive dose was excreted within 48 hours following dose administration.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In humans, 14C-thalidomide is primarily excreted in urine (91.9% of the radioactive dose) mainly as hydrolytic metabolites while fecal excretion is minor (<2% of the dose).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Unchanged thalidomide is not eliminated by the kidney to a notable degree (<3.5% of the dose).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effects of Weight There is a linear relationship between body weight and estimated thalidomide clearance.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In MM patients with body weight from 47-133 kg, thalidomide clearance ranged from approximately 6-12 L/h, representing an increase in thalidomide clearance of 0.605 L/h per 10 kg body weight increase.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effects of Age, Gender and Race Analysis of the data from pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers and patients with Hansen's disease ranging in age from 20 to 69 years does not reveal any age-related changes.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	While a comparative trial of the effects of gender on thalidomide pharmacokinetics has not been conducted, examination of the data for thalidomide does not reveal any significant gender differences in pharmacokinetic parameter values.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Pharmacokinetic Data in Special Populations HIV-seropositive Subjects: There is no apparent significant difference in measured pharmacokinetic parameter values between healthy human subjects and HIV-seropositive subjects following single-dose administration of THALOMID Capsules.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients with Hansen's Disease: Analysis of data from a small study in Hansen's patients suggests that these patients, relative to healthy subjects, may have an increased bioavailability of THALOMID.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The increase is reflected both in an increased area under the curve and in increased peak plasma levels.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Pediatric: No pharmacokinetic data are available in subjects below the age of 18 years.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Although the exact frequency of occurrence has not been determined, it has occurred in 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, and sometimes fever, headache, and rash.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with LIALDA.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Some patients who have experienced a hypersensitivity reaction to sulfasalazine may have a similar reaction to LIALDA tablets or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Mesalamine-induced cardiac hypersensitivity reactions (myocarditis and pericarditis) have been reported with LIALDA and other mesalamine medications.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Caution should be taken in prescribing this medicine to patients with conditions predisposing them to the development of myocarditis or pericarditis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered mesalamine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Caution should be exercised when administering LIALDA to patients with liver disease.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Severe infections including sepsis, which may be fatal, have been reported in patients receiving ARAVA, especially Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia and aspergillosis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Most of the reports were confounded by concomitant immunosuppressant therapy and/or comorbid illness which, in addition to rheumatoid arthritis, may predispose patients to infection.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cases of tuberculosis were observed in clinical studies with teriflunomide, the metabolite of ARAVA.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Prior to initiating ARAVA, all patients should be screened for active and inactive (latent) tuberculosis infection as per commonly used diagnostic tests.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	If evidence of bone marrow suppression occurs in a patient taking ARAVA, stop treatment with ARAVA, and perform an accelerated drug elimination procedure to reduce the plasma concentration of the ARAVA active metabolite, teriflunomide.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In any situation in which the decision is made to switch from ARAVA to another anti-rheumatic agent with a known potential for hematologic suppression, it would be prudent to monitor for hematologic toxicity, because there will be overlap of systemic exposure to both compounds.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rare cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) have been reported in patients receiving ARAVA.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate requires initial diester hydrolysis for conversion to tenofovir and subsequent phosphorylations by cellular enzymes to form tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP), an obligate chain terminator.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Tenofovir diphosphate inhibits the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) and HBV RT by competing with the natural substrate deoxyadenosine 5'-triphosphate and, after incorporation into DNA, by DNA chain termination.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Tenofovir diphosphate is a weak inhibitor of mammalian DNA polymerases <U+03B1>, <U+03B2>, and mitochondrial DNA polymerase <U+03B3>.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	The EC50 (50% effective concentration) values for tenofovir were in the range of 0.04 <U+00B5>M to 8.5 <U+00B5>M.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In drug combination studies, tenofovir was not antagonistic with HIV-1 NRTIs (abacavir, didanosine, lamivudine, stavudine, zidovudine), NNRTIs (efavirenz, nevirapine), and protease inhibitors (amprenavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Tenofovir displayed antiviral activity in cell culture against HIV-1 clades A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and O (EC50 values ranged from 0.5 <U+00B5>M to 2.2 <U+00B5>M) and strain-specific activity against HIV-2 (EC50 values ranged from 1.6 <U+00B5>M to 5.5 <U+00B5>M).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Resistance HIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to tenofovir have been selected in cell culture.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These viruses expressed a K65R substitution in RT and showed a 2- to 4-fold reduction in susceptibility to tenofovir.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In addition, a K70E substitution in HIV-1 RT has been selected by tenofovir and results in low-level reduced susceptibility to tenofovir.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In Trial 903 of treatment-na<U+00C3><U+00AF>ve subjects (VIREAD+3TC+EFV versus d4T+3TC+EFV), genotypic analyses of isolates from subjects with virologic failure through Week 144 showed development of EFV and 3TC resistance-associated substitutions to occur most frequently and with no difference between the treatment arms.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The K65R substitution occurred in 8/47 (17%) of analyzed patient isolates in the VIREAD arm and in 2/49 (4%) of analyzed patient isolates in the d4T arm.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Of the 8 subjects whose virus developed K65R in the VIREAD arm through 144 weeks, 7 occurred in the first 48 weeks of treatment and one at Week 96.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	One patient in the VIREAD arm developed the K70E substitution in the virus.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Other substitutions resulting in resistance to VIREAD were not identified in this trial.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In Trial 934 of treatment-na<U+00C3><U+00AF>ve subjects (VIREAD+FTC+EFV versus AZT/3TC+EFV), genotypic analysis performed on HIV-1 isolates from all confirmed virologic failure subjects with >400 copies/mL of HIV-1 RNA at Week 144 or early discontinuation showed development of EFV resistance-associated substitutions occurred most frequently and was similar between the two treatment arms.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The M184V substitution, associated with resistance to FTC and 3TC, was observed in 2/19 of analyzed subject isolates in the VIREAD+FTC group and in 10/29 of analyzed subject isolates in the AZT/3TC group.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Through 144 weeks of Trial 934, no subjects have developed a detectable K65R substitution in their HIV-1 as analyzed through standard genotypic analysis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cross Resistance Cross resistance among certain HIV-1 NRTIs has been recognized.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The K65R and K70E substitutions selected by tenofovir are also selected in some HIV-1 infected subjects treated with abacavir or didanosine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	HIV-1 isolates with this substitution also show reduced susceptibility to FTC and 3TC.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, cross resistance among these drugs may occur in patients whose virus harbors the K65R or K70E substitution.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	HIV-1 isolates from subjects (N=20) whose HIV-1 expressed a mean of three AZT-associated RT substitutions (M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y/F, or K219Q/E/N), showed a 3.1-fold decrease in the susceptibility to tenofovir.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In Trials 902 and 907 conducted in treatment-experienced subjects (VIREAD + Standard Background Therapy (SBT) compared to placebo + SBT), 14/304 (5%) of the VIREAD-treated subjects with virologic failure through Week 96 had >1.4-fold (median 2.7-fold) reduced susceptibility to tenofovir.

5	Varying degrees of cross resistance of VIREAD to pre-existing AZT resistance-associated substitutions (M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y/F, or K219Q/E/N) were observed and appeared to depend on the type and number of specific substitutions.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	VIREAD-treated subjects whose HIV-1 expressed 3 or more AZT resistance-associated substitutions that included either the M41L or L210W RT substitution showed reduced responses to VIREAD therapy; however, these responses were still improved compared with placebo.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The presence of the D67N, K70R, T215Y/F, or K219Q/E/N substitution did not appear to affect responses to VIREAD therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Subjects whose virus expressed an L74V substitution without AZT resistance-associated substitutions (N=8) had reduced response to VIREAD.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Limited data are available for subjects whose virus expressed a Y115F substitution (N=3), Q151M substitution (N=2), or T69 insertion (N=4), all of whom had a reduced response.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	The majority of Saxenda-treated patients with adverse events of cholelithiasis and cholecystitis required cholecystectomy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Substantial or rapid weight loss can increase the risk of cholelithiasis; however, the incidence of acute gallbladder disease was greater in Saxenda-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients even after accounting for the degree of weight loss.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If cholelithiasis is suspected, gallbladder studies and appropriate clinical follow-up are indicated.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The risk for serious hypoglycemia is increased when Saxenda is used in combination with insulin secretagogues (for example, sulfonylureas) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Liraglutide is an acylated human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist with 97% amino acid sequence homology to endogenous human GLP-1(7-37).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Like endogenous GLP-1, liraglutide binds to and activates the GLP-1 receptor, a cell-surface receptor coupled to adenylyl cyclase activation through the stimulatory G-protein, Gs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Endogenous GLP-1 has a half-life of 1.5-2 minutes due to degradation by the ubiquitous endogenous enzymes, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) and neutral endopeptidases (NEP).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Unlike native GLP-1, liraglutide is stable against metabolic degradation by both peptidases and has a plasma half-life of 13 hours after subcutaneous administration.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The pharmacokinetic profile of liraglutide, which makes it suitable for once-daily administration, is a result of self-association that delays absorption, plasma protein binding, and stability against metabolic degradation by DPP-4 and NEP.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	GLP-1 is a physiological regulator of appetite and calorie intake, and the GLP-1 receptor is present in several areas of the brain involved in appetite regulation.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In animal studies, peripheral administration of liraglutide resulted in the presence of liraglutide in specific brain regions regulating appetite, including the hypothalamus.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Although liraglutide activated neurons in brain regions known to regulate appetite, specific brain regions mediating the effects of liraglutide on appetite were not identified in rats.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Metabolism - During the initial 24 hours following administration of a single [3H]-liraglutide dose to healthy subjects, the major component in plasma was intact liraglutide.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Liraglutide is endogenously metabolized in a similar manner to large proteins without a specific organ as a major route of elimination.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Elimination - Following a [3H]-liraglutide dose, intact liraglutide was not detected in urine or feces.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Only a minor part of the administered radioactivity was excreted as liraglutide-related metabolites in urine or feces (6% and 5%, respectively).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	This condition should be treated with insulin.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There is no fixed dosage regimen for the management of diabetes mellitus with tolbutamide tablets or any other hypoglycemic agent.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In addition to the usual monitoring of urinary glucose, the patient's blood glucose must also be monitored periodically to determine the minimum effective dose for the patient; to detect primary failure, i.e., inadequate lowering of blood glucose at the maximum recommended dose of medication; and to detect secondary failure, i.e., loss of an adequate blood glucose lowering response after an initial period of effectiveness.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Glycosylated hemoglobin levels may also be of value in monitoring the patient's response to therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Short-term administration of tolbutamide tablets may be sufficient during periods of transient loss of control in patients usually controlled well on diet.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	When transferring patients from oral hypoglycemic agents other than chlorpropamide to tolbutamide, no transition period and no initial or priming doses are necessary.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When transferring patients from chlorpropamide, however, particular care should be exercised during the first 2 weeks because of the prolonged retention of chlorpropamide, in the body and the possibility that subsequent overlapping drug effects might provoke hypoglycemia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients requiring 20 units or less of insulin daily may be placed directly on tolbutamide tablets and insulin abruptly discontinued.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients whose insulin requirement is between 20 and 40 units daily may be started on therapy with tolbutamide tablets with a concurrent 30% to 50% reduction in insulin dose, with further daily reduction of the insulin when response to tolbutamide tablets is observed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In patients requiring more than 40 units of insulin daily, therapy with tolbutamide tablets may be initiated in conjunction with a 20% reduction in insulin dose the first day, with further careful reduction of insulin as response is observed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Occasionally, conversion to tolbutamide tablets in the hospital may be advisable in candidates who require more than 40 units of insulin daily.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During this conversion period when both insulin and tolbutamide tablets are being used hypoglycemia may rarely occur.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During insulin withdrawal, patients should test their urine for glucose and acetone at least 3 times daily and report results to their physician.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The appearance of persistent acetonuria with glycosuria indicates that the patient is type I diabetic who requires insulin therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Daily doses of greater than 3 grams are not recommended.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The maintenance dose is in the range of 0.25 to 3 grams daily.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Maintenance doses above 2 grams are seldom required.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	All sulfonylurea drugs are capable of producing severe hypoglycemia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Proper patient selection, dosage, and instructions are important to avoid hypoglycemic episodes.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Renal or hepatic insufficiency may cause elevated blood levels of tolbutamide and the latter may also diminish gluconeogenic capacity, both of which increase the risk of serious hypoglycemic reactions.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Elderly, debilitated or malnourished patients, and those with adrenal or pituitary insufficiency are particularly susceptible to the hypoglycemic action of glucose-lowering drugs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in the elderly, and in people who are taking beta-adrenergic blocking drugs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hypoglycemia is more likely to occur when caloric intake is deficient, after severe or prolonged exercise, when alcohol is ingested, or when more than one glucose-lowering drug is used.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When a patient stabilized on any diabetic regimen is exposed to stress such as fever, trauma, infection, or surgery, a loss of control may occur.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	At such times, it may be necessary to discontinue tolbutamide and administer insulin.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effectiveness of any oral hypoglycemic drug, including tolbutamide, in lowering blood glucose to a desired level decreases in many patients over a period of time, which may be due to progression of the severity of the diabetes or to diminished responsiveness to the drug.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This phenomenon is known as a secondary failure, to distinguish it from primary failure in which the drug is ineffective in an individual patient when first given.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Adequate adjustment of dose and adherence to diet should be assessed before classifying a patient as a secondary failure.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Treatment of patients with glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency with sulfonylurea agents can lead to hemolytic anemia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because tolbutamide belongs to the class of sulfonylurea agents, caution should be used in patients with G6PD deficiency and a non-sulfonylurea alternative should be considered.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In post-marketing reports, hemolytic anemia has also been reported in patients who did not have known G6PD deficiency.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients should be informed of the potential risks and advantages of tolbutamide and of alternative modes of therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	They should also be informed about the importance of adherence to dietary instructions, of a regular exercise program, and of regular testing of urine and/or blood glucose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The risks of hypoglycemia, its symptoms and treatment, and conditions that predispose to its development should be explained to patients and responsible family members.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Primary and secondary failure should also be explained.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Blood and urine glucose should be monitored periodically.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Measurement of glycosylated hemoglobin may be useful.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A metabolite of tolbutamide in urine may give a false positive reaction for albumin if measured by the acidification-after-boiling test, which causes the metabolite to precipitate.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There is no interference with the sulfosalicylic acid test.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Bioassay for carcinogenicity was performed in both sexes of rats and mice following ingestion of tolbutamide for 78 weeks.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	No evidence of carcinogenicity was found.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Tolbutamide has also been demonstrated to be nonmutagenic in the Ames salmonella/mammalian microsome mutagenicity test.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Tolbutamide has been shown to be teratogenic in rats when given in doses 25 to 100 times the human dose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In some studies, pregnant rats given high doses of tolbutamide have shown ocular and bony abnormalities and increased mortality in offspring.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Repeat studies in other species (rabbits) have not demonstrated a teratogenic effect.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Tolbutamide is not recommended for the treatment of pregnant diabetic patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Serious consideration should also be given to the possible hazards of the use of tolbutamide in women of childbearing age and in those who might become pregnant while using the drug.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because recent information suggests that abnormal blood glucose levels during pregnancy are associated with a higher incidence of congenital abnormalities, many experts recommend that insulin be used during pregnancy to maintain blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Prolonged severe hypoglycemia (4 to 10 days) has been reported in neonates born to mothers who were receiving a sulfonylurea drug at the time of delivery.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This has been reported more frequently with the use of agents with prolonged half-lives.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If tolbutamide is used during pregnancy, it should be discontinued at least 2 weeks before the expected delivery date.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Although it is not known whether tolbutamide is excreted in human milk, some sulfonylurea drugs are known to be excreted in human milk.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because the potential for hypoglycemia in nursing infants may exist, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If the drug is discontinued and if diet alone is inadequate for controlling blood glucose, insulin therapy should be considered.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The administration of oral hypoglycemic drugs has been reported to be associated with increased cardiovascular mortality as compared to treatment with diet alone or diet plus insulin.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This warning is based on the study conducted by the University Group Diabetes Program (UGDP), a long-term prospective clinical trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of glucose-lowering drugs in preventing or delaying vascular complications in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The study involved 823 patients who were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups (Diabetes, 19 (supp.2):747-830, 1970).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	UGDP reported that patients treated for 5 to 8 years with diet plus a fixed dose of tolbutamide (1.5 grams per day) had a rate of cardiovascular mortality approximately 2<U+00BD> times that of patients treated with diet alone.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A significant increase in total mortality was not observed, but the use of tolbutamide was discontinued based on the increase in cardiovascular mortality, thus limiting the opportunity for the study to show an increase in overall mortality.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Despite controversy regarding the interpretation of these results, the findings of the UGDP study provide an adequate basis for this warning.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The patient should be informed of the potential risks and advantages of tolbutamide and of alternative modes of therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Although only one drug in the sulfonylurea class (tolbutamide) was included in this study, it is prudent from a safety standpoint to consider that this warning may also apply to other oral hypoglycemic drugs in this class, in view of their close similarities in mode of action and chemical structure.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Tolbutamide appears to lower the blood glucose acutely by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreas, an effect dependent upon functioning beta cells in the pancreatic islets.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The mechanism by which tolbutamide lowers blood glucose during long-term administration has not been clearly established.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	With chronic administration in Type II diabetic patients, the blood-glucose-lowering effect persists despite a gradual decline in the insulin secretory response to the drug.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Extrapancreatic effects may be involved in the mechanism of action of oral sulfonylurea hypoglycemic drugs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Some patients who are initially responsive to oral hypoglycemic drugs, including tolbutamide, may become unresponsive or poorly responsive over time.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Alternatively, tolbutamide may be effective in some patients who have become unresponsive to one or more of the other sulfonylurea drugs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When administered orally, tolbutamide is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Absorption is not impaired and glucose lowering and insulin releasing effects are not altered if the drug is taken with food.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Detectable levels are present in the plasma within 20 minutes after oral ingestion of a 500 mg tolbutamide tablet, with peak levels occurring at 3 to 4 hours and only small amounts detectable at 24 hours.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The half-life of tolbutamide is 4.5 to 6.5 hours.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	As tolbutamide has no p-amino group, it cannot be acetylated, which is one of the common modes of metabolic degradation for the antibacterial sulfonamides.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, the presence of the p-methyl group renders tolbutamide susceptible to oxidation, and this appears to be the principal manner of its metabolic degradation in man.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The p-methyl group is oxidized to form a carboxyl group, converting tolbutamide into the totally inactive metabolite 1-butyl-3-p-carboxy-phenylsulfonylurea, which can be recovered in the urine within 24 hours in amounts accounting for up to 75% of the administered dose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The major tolbutamide metabolite has been found to have no hypoglycemic or other action when administered orally and IV to both normal and diabetic subjects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This tolbutamide metabolite is highly soluble over the critical acid range of urinary pH values, and its solubility increases with increase in pH.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because of the marked solubility of the tolbutamide metabolite, crystalluria does not occur.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A second metabolite, 1-butyl-3-(p-hydroxymethyl) phenyl sulfonylurea also occurs to a limited extent.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The administration of 3 grams of tolbutamide to either nondiabetic or tolbutamide-responsive diabetic subjects will, in both instances, occasion a gradual lowering of blood glucose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Increasing the dose to 6 grams does not usually cause a response which is significantly different from that produced by the 3 gram dose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Following the administration of a 3 gram dose of tolbutamide solution, non-diabetic fasting adults exhibit a 30% or greater reduction in blood glucose within one hour, following which the blood glucose gradually returns to the fasting level over 6 to 12 hours.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Following the administration of a 3 gram dose of tolbutamide solution, tolbutamide responsive diabetic patients show a gradually progressive blood glucose lowering effect, the maximal response being reached between 5 to 8 hours after ingestion of a single 3 gram dose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The blood glucose then rises gradually and by the 24th hour has usually returned to pretest levels.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The magnitude of the reduction, when expressed in terms of percent of the pretest blood glucose, tends to be similar to the response seen in the nondiabetic subject.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Exacerbation of Ischemic Heart Disease Following Abrupt Withdrawal<U+2014>Hypersensitivity to catecholamines has been observed in patients withdrawn from beta-blocker therapy; exacerbation of angina and, in some cases, myocardial infarction have occurred after abrupt discontinuation of such therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When discontinuing chronically administered nadolol, particularly in patients with ischemic heart disease, the dosage should be gradually reduced over a period of one to two weeks and the patient should be carefully monitored.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If angina markedly worsens or acute coronary insufficiency develops, nadolol administration should be reinstituted promptly, at least temporarily, and other measures appropriate for the management of unstable angina should be taken.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients should be warned against interruption or discontinuation of therapy without the physician's advice.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized, it may be prudent not to discontinue nadolol therapy abruptly even in patients treated only for hypertension.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Nadolol is contraindicated in bronchial asthma, sinus bradycardia and greater than first degree conduction block, cardiogenic shock, and overt cardiac failure.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Bendroflumethiazide is contraindicated in anuria.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is also contraindicated in patients who have previously demonstrated hypersensitivity to bendroflumethiazide or other sulfonamide-derived drugs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	DOSAGE MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CORZIDE MAY BE ADMINISTERED WITHOUT REGARD TO MEALS.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Bendroflumethiazide is usually given at a dose of 5 mg daily.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The usual initial dose of nadolol is 40 mg once daily whether used alone or in combination with a diuretic.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Bendroflumethiazide in CORZIDE is 30 percent more bioavailable than that of 5 mg Naturetin tablets.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Conversion from 5 mg NATURETIN to CORZIDE represents a 30 percent increase in dose of bendroflumethiazide.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The initial dose of CORZIDE (Nadolol and Bendroflumethiazide Tablets) may therefore be the 40 mg/5 mg tablet once daily.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When the antihypertensive response is not satisfactory, the dose may be increased by administering the 80 mg/5 mg tablet once daily.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When necessary, another antihypertensive agent may be added gradually beginning with 50 percent of the usual recommended starting dose to avoid an excessive fall in blood pressure.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dosage Adjustment in Renal Failure<U+2014>Absorbed nadolol is excreted principally by the kidneys and, although nonrenal elimination does occur, dosage adjustments are necessary in patients with renal impairment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The following dose intervals are recommended: Creatinine Clearance (mL/min/1.73 m2) Dosage Interval (hours) >50 24 31<U+2013>50 24<U+2013>36 10<U+2013>30 24<U+2013>48 <10 40<U+2013>60	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Bendroflumethiazide may produce false-negative results with the phentolamine and tyramine tests; may interfere with the phenolsulfonphthalein test due to decreased excretion; and it may cause diagnostic interference of serum electrolyte levels, blood and urine glucose levels, and a decrease in serum PBI levels without signs of thyroid disturbance.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When administered concurrently the following drugs may interact with beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents: Anesthetics, general<U+2014>exaggeration of the hypotension induced by general anesthetics.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Antidiabetic drugs (oral agents and insulin)<U+2014>hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia; adjust dosage of antidiabetic drug accordingly.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Catecholamine-depleting drugs (e.g., reserpine)<U+2014>additive effect; monitor closely for evidence of hypotension and/or excessive bradycardia (e.g., vertigo, syncope, postural hypotension).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Digitalis glycosides<U+2014>Both digitalis glycosides and beta-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Response to Treatment for Anaphylactic Reaction<U+2014>While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge, either accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reaction.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When administered concurrently the following drugs may interact with thiazide diuretics: Alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics<U+2014>potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Amphotericin B, corticosteroids, or corticotropin (ACTH)<U+2014>may intensify electrolyte imbalance, particularly hypokalemia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Monitor potassium levels; use potassium replacements if necessary.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Anticoagulants (oral)<U+2014>dosage adjustments of anticoagulant medication may be necessary since bendroflumethiazide may decrease their effects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Antigout medications<U+2014>dosage adjustments of antigout medication may be necessary since bendroflumethiazide may raise the level of blood uric acid.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Other antihypertensive medications (e.g., ganglionic or peripheral adrenergic blocking agents)<U+2014>dosage adjustments may be necessary since bendroflumethiazide may potentiate their effects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Antidiabetic drugs (oral agents and insulin)<U+2014>since thiazides may elevate blood glucose levels, dosage adjustments of antidiabetic agents may be necessary.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If calcium must be prescribed monitor serum calcium levels and adjust calcium dosage accordingly.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cardiac glycosides<U+2014>enhanced possibility of digitalis toxicity associated with hypokalemia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Monitor potassium levels; use potassium replacement if necessary.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Sulfonamide diuretics should be taken at least one hour before or four to six hours after these medications.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Diazoxide<U+2014>enhanced hyperglycemic, hyperuricemic, and antihypertensive effects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Be cognizant of possible interaction; monitor blood glucose and serum uric acid levels.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Avoid concurrent use; if lithium must be prescribed monitor serum lithium levels and adjust lithium dosage accordingly.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	MAO inhibitors<U+2014>dosage adjustments of one or both agents may be necessary since hypotensive effects are enhanced.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Nondepolarizing muscle relaxants, preanesthetics and anesthetics used in surgery (e.g., tubocurarine chloride and gallamine triethiodide)<U+2014>effects of these agents may be potentiated; dosage adjustments may be required.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Monitor and correct any fluid and electrolyte imbalances prior to surgery if feasible.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents<U+2014>in some patients, the administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effect of loop, potassium-sparing or thiazide diuretics.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, when bendroflumethiazide and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Methenamine<U+2014>possible decreased effectiveness due to alkalinization of the urine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Pressor amines (e.g., norepinephrine)<U+2014>decreased arterial responsiveness, but not sufficient to preclude effectiveness of the pressor agent for therapeutic use.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Use caution in patients taking both medications who undergo surgery.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Administer preanesthetic and anesthetic agents in reduced dosage, and if possible, discontinue bendroflumethiazide one week prior to surgery.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Probenecid or sulfinpyrazone<U+2014>increased dosage of these agents may be necessary since bendroflumethiazide may have hyperuricemic effects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Nadolol should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Periodic determination of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	All patients receiving thiazide therapy should be observed for clinical signs of fluid or electrolyte imbalance, namely: hyponatremia, hypochloremic alkalosis, and hypokalemia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Serum and urine electrolyte determinations are particularly important when the patient is vomiting excessively or receiving parenteral fluids.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Warning signs or symptoms of fluid and electrolyte imbalance may include: dryness of the mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pains or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal disturbances, such as nausea and vomiting.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hypokalemia may develop, especially with brisk diuresis or when severe cirrhosis is present.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Interference with adequate oral electrolyte intake will also contribute to hypokalemia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hypokalemia can sensitize or exaggerate the response of the heart to the toxic effects of digitalis (e.g., increased ventricular irritability).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concurrent administration of a potassium-sparing diuretic or potassium supplements may be indicated in these patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Any chloride deficit is generally mild and usually does not require specific treatment except under extraordinary circumstances (as in liver disease or renal disease).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dilutional hyponatremia may occur in edematous patients in hot weather; appropriate therapy is water restriction, rather than administration of salt, except in rare instances when the hyponatremia is life-threatening.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In actual salt depletion, appropriate replacement is the therapy of choice.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hyperuricemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Latent diabetes mellitus may become manifest during thiazide administration.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The antihypertensive effect of thiazide diuretics may be enhanced in the postsympathectomy patient.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If progressive renal impairment becomes evident, as indicated by a rising nonprotein nitrogen or blood urea nitrogen (BUN), a careful reappraisal of therapy is necessary with consideration given to withholding or discontinuing diuretic therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thiazides may decrease serum PBI levels without signs of thyroid disturbance.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Pathological changes in the parathyroid gland with hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia have been observed in a few patients on prolonged thiazide therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The common complications of hyperparathyroidism such as renal lithiasis, bone resorption, and peptic ulceration have not been seen.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thiazides have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium; this may result in hypomagnesemia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients, especially those with evidence of coronary artery insufficiency, should be warned against interruption or discontinuation of therapy without the physician's advice.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Although cardiac failure rarely occurs in properly selected patients, patients being treated with beta-adrenergic blocking agents should be advised to consult the physician at the first sign or symptom of impending failure.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The patient should also be advised of a proper course in the event of an inadvertently missed dose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The patient should be informed of symptoms that would suggest potential adverse effects and told to report them promptly.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Serum electrolyte levels should be regularly monitored.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In chronic oral toxicologic studies (one to two years) in mice, rats, and dogs, nadolol did not produce any significant toxic effects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In two-year oral carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice, nadolol did not produce any neoplastic, preneoplastic, or nonneoplastic pathologic lesions.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In fertility and general reproductive performance studies in rats, nadolol caused no adverse effect.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Studies have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, mutagenesis, or whether this drug adversely affects fertility in males or females.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In animal reproduction studies with nadolol, evidence of embryo-and fetotoxicity was found in rabbits, but not in rats or hamsters, at doses 5 to 10 times greater (on a mg/kg basis) than the maximum indicated human dose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	No teratogenic potential was observed in any of these species.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Nadolol should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Neonates whose mothers are receiving nadolol at parturition have exhibited bradycardia, hypoglycemia, and associated symptoms.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with bendroflumethiazide.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is also not known whether this drug can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Bendroflumethiazide should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thiazides cross the placental barrier and appear in cord blood.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The use of thiazides in pregnant women requires that the anticipated benefit be weighed against possible hazards to the fetus.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These hazards include fetal or neonatal jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and possibly other adverse reactions which have occurred in the adult.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Both nadolol and bendroflumethiazide are excreted in human milk.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from both drugs, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue therapy taking into account the importance of CORZIDE (Nadolol and Bendroflumethiazide Tablets) to the mother.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Clinical studies of Corzide did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reaction to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired function.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cardiac Failure <U+2014>Sympathetic stimulation may be a vital component supporting circulatory function in patients with congestive heart failure, and its inhibition by beta-blockade may precipitate more severe failure.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Although beta-blockers should be avoided in overt congestive heart failure, if necessary, they can be used with caution in patients with a history of failure who are well compensated, usually with digitalis and diuretics.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Beta-adrenergic blocking agents do not abolish the inotropic action of digitalis on heart muscle.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	IN PATIENTS WITHOUT A HISTORY OF HEART FAILURE, continued use of beta-blockers can, in some cases, lead to cardiac failure.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, at the first sign or symptom of heart failure, the patient should be digitalized and/or treated with diuretics, and the response observed closely, or nadolol should be discontinued (gradually, if possible).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Nonallergic Bronchospasm (e.g., chronic bronchitis, emphysema) <U+2014> PATIENTS WITH BRONCHOSPASTIC DISEASES SHOULD IN GENERAL NOT RECEIVE BETA-BLOCKERS.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Nadolol should be administered with caution since it may block bronchodilation produced by endogenous or exogenous catecholamine stimulation of beta2 receptors.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Major Surgery <U+2014>Chronically administered beta-blocking therapy should not be routinely withdrawn prior to major surgery; however, the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Diabetes and Hypoglycemia <U+2014>Beta-adrenergic blockade may prevent the appearance of premonitory signs and symptoms (e.g., tachycardia and blood pressure changes) of acute hypoglycemia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This is especially important with labile diabetics.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Beta-blockade also reduces the release of insulin in response to hyperglycemia; therefore, it may be necessary to adjust the dose of antidiabetic drugs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thyrotoxicosis <U+2014>Beta-adrenergic blockade may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients suspected of developing thyrotoxicosis should be managed carefully to avoid abrupt withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blockade which might precipitate a thyroid storm.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thiazides should be used with caution in severe renal disease.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In patients with renal disease, thiazides may precipitate azotemia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cumulative effects of the drug may develop in patients with impaired renal function.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Sensitivity reactions may occur in patients with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The possibility of exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus has been reported.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Refer to the package insert for lithium preparations before use of such concomitant therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Nadolol is a nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Clinical pharmacology studies have demonstrated beta-blocking activity by showing (1) reduction in heart rate and cardiac output at rest and on exercise, (2) reduction of systolic and diastolic blood pressure at rest and on exercise, (3) inhibition of isoproterenol-induced tachycardia, and (4) reduction of reflex orthostatic tachycardia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Nadolol specifically competes with beta-adrenergic receptor agonists for available beta receptor sites; it inhibits both the beta1 receptors located chiefly in cardiac muscle and the beta2 receptors located chiefly in the bronchial and vascular musculature, inhibiting the chronotropic, inotropic, and vasodilator responses to beta-adrenergic stimulation proportionately.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Nadolol has no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and, unlike some other beta-adrenergic blocking agents, nadolol has little direct myocardial depressant activity and does not have an anesthetic-like membrane-stabilizing action.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Animal and human studies show that nadolol slows the sinus rate and depresses AV conduction.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In dogs, only minimal amounts of nadolol were detected in the brain relative to amounts in blood and other organs and tissues.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Nadolol has low lipophilicity as determined by octanol/water partition coefficient, a characteristic of certain beta-blocking agents that has been correlated with the limited extent to which these agents cross the blood-brain barrier, their low concentration in the brain, and low incidence of CNS-related side effects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In controlled clinical studies, nadolol at doses of 40 to 320 mg/day has been shown to decrease both standing and supine blood pressure, the effect persisting for approximately 24 hours after dosing.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The mechanism of the antihypertensive effects of beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents has not been established; however, factors that may be involved include (1) competitive antagonism of catecholamines at peripheral (non-CNS) adrenergic neuron sites (especially cardiac) leading to decreased cardiac output, (2) a central effect leading to reduced tonic-sympathetic nerve outflow to the periphery, and (3) suppression of renin secretion by blockade of the beta-adrenergic receptors responsible for renin release from the kidneys.

5	While cardiac output and arterial pressure are reduced by nadolol therapy, renal hemodynamics are stable, with preservation of renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	By blocking catecholamine-induced increases in heart rate, velocity and extent of myocardial contraction, and blood pressure, nadolol generally reduces the oxygen requirements of the heart at any given level of effort, making it useful for many patients in the long-term management of angina pectoris.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	On the other hand, nadolol can increase oxygen requirements by increasing left ventricular fiber length and end diastolic pressure, particularly in patients with heart failure.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Although beta-adrenergic receptor blockade is useful in treatment of angina and hypertension, there are also situations in which sympathetic stimulation is vital.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For example, in patients with severely damaged hearts, adequate ventricular function may depend on sympathetic drive.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Beta-adrenergic blockade may worsen AV block by preventing the necessary facilitating effects of sympathetic activity on conduction.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Beta2-adrenergic blockade results in passive bronchial constriction by interfering with endogenous adrenergic bronchodilator activity in patients subject to bronchospasm and may also interfere with exogenous bronchodilators in such patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Absorption of nadolol after oral dosing is variable, averaging about 30 percent.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Peak serum concentrations of nadolol usually occur in three to four hours after oral administration and the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract does not affect the rate or extent of nadolol absorption.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	If patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD receiving SELZENTRY (without concomitant CYP3A inducers or inhibitors) experience postural hypotension, the dose of SELZENTRY should be reduced from 300 mg twice daily to 150 mg twice daily.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hepatotoxicity with allergic features including life-threatening events has been reported in clinical trials and postmarketing.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Severe rash or evidence of systemic allergic reaction including drug-related rash with fever, eosinophilia, elevated IgE, or other systemic symptoms have been reported in conjunction with hepatotoxicity.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These events occurred approximately 1 month after starting treatment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Among reported cases of hepatitis, some were observed in the absence of allergic features or with no pre-existing hepatic disease.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Appropriate laboratory testing including ALT, AST, and bilirubin should be conducted prior to initiating therapy with SELZENTRY and at other time points during treatment as clinically indicated.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hepatic laboratory parameters should be obtained in any patient who develops rash, or signs or symptoms of hepatitis, or allergic reaction.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Discontinuation of SELZENTRY should be considered in any patient with signs or symptoms of hepatitis, or with increased liver transaminases combined with rash or other systemic symptoms.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The safety and efficacy of SELZENTRY have not been specifically studied in patients with significant underlying liver disorders.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Severe, potentially life-threatening skin and hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking SELZENTRY, in most cases concomitantly with other drugs associated with these reactions.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These include cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The cases were characterized by features including rash, constitutional findings, and sometimes organ dysfunction, including hepatic failure.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Discontinue SELZENTRY and other suspected agents immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin or hypersensitivity reactions develop (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, malaise, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, lip swelling, eosinophilia).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Delay in stopping treatment with SELZENTRY or other suspect drugs after the onset of rash may result in a life-threatening reaction.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Clinical status, including liver aminotransferases, should be monitored and appropriate therapy initiated.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Eleven subjects (1.3%) who received SELZENTRY had cardiovascular events, including myocardial ischemia and/or infarction, during the Phase 3 trials in treatment-experienced subjects (total exposure 609 patient-years [300 on SELZENTRY once daily + 309 on SELZENTRY twice daily]), while no subjects who received placebo had such events (total exposure 111 patient-years).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These subjects generally had cardiac disease or cardiac risk factors prior to use of SELZENTRY, and the relative contribution of SELZENTRY to these events is not known.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In the Phase 2b/3 trial in treatment-naive adult subjects, 3 subjects (0.8%) who received SELZENTRY had events related to ischemic heart disease and 5 subjects (1.4%) who received efavirenz had such events (total exposure 506 and 508 patient-years for SELZENTRY and efavirenz, respectively).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When SELZENTRY was administered to healthy volunteers at doses higher than the recommended dose, symptomatic postural hypotension was seen at a greater frequency than in placebo.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, when SELZENTRY was given at the recommended dose in HIV-1-infected adult subjects in Phase 3 trials, postural hypotension was seen at a rate similar to placebo (approximately 0.5%).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients with cardiovascular comorbidities, risk factors for postural hypotension, or receiving concomitant medication known to lower blood pressure, could be at increased risk of cardiovascular adverse events triggered by postural hypotension.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Postural Hypotension in Patients with Renal Impairment An increased risk of postural hypotension may occur in patients with severe renal insufficiency or in those with ESRD due to increased maraviroc exposure in some patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	SELZENTRY should be used in patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD only if they are not receiving a concomitant potent CYP3A inhibitor or inducer.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, the use of SELZENTRY in these patients should only be considered when no alternative treatment options are available.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If adult patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD experience any symptoms of postural hypotension while taking 300 mg twice daily, the dose should be reduced to 150 mg twice daily.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including SELZENTRY.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as infection with Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], tuberculosis, or reactivation of Herpes simplex and Herpes zoster), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves<U+2019> disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barr<U+00C3><U+00A9> syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	SELZENTRY antagonizes the CCR5 co-receptor located on some immune cells, and therefore could potentially increase the risk of developing infections.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The overall incidence and severity of infection, as well as AIDS-defining category C infections, were comparable in the treatment groups during the Phase 3 adult treatment-experienced trials of SELZENTRY.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	While there was a higher rate of certain upper respiratory tract infections reported in the treatment arm receiving SELZENTRY compared with placebo (23% versus 13%), there was a lower rate of pneumonia (2% versus 5%) reported in subjects receiving SELZENTRY.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A higher incidence of Herpes virus infections (11 per 100 patient-years) was also reported in the treatment arm receiving SELZENTRY when adjusted for exposure compared with placebo (8 per 100 patient-years).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In the Phase 2b/3 trial in treatment-naive adult subjects, the incidence of AIDS-defining Category C events when adjusted for exposure was 1.8 for SELZENTRY compared with 2.4 for efavirenz per 100 patient-years of exposure.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients should be monitored closely for evidence of infections while receiving SELZENTRY.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	While no increase in malignancy has been observed with SELZENTRY, due to this drug<U+2019>s mechanism of action, it could affect immune surveillance and lead to an increased risk of malignancy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The exposure-adjusted rate for malignancies per 100 patient-years of exposure in adult treatment-experienced trials was 4.6 for SELZENTRY compared with 9.3 on placebo.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In treatment-naive adult subjects, the rates were 1.0 and 2.4 per 100 patient-years of exposure for SELZENTRY and efavirenz, respectively.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	The pharmacokinetics of oral maraviroc are not dose proportional over the dose range.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The absolute bioavailability of a 100<U+2011>mg dose is 23% and is predicted to be 33% at 300 mg. Maraviroc is a substrate for the efflux transporter P-gp.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Studies with the tablet formulation demonstrated a reduced food effect at higher doses.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There were no food restrictions in the adult trials (using the tablet formulation) or in the pediatric trial (using both tablet and oral solution formulations) that demonstrated the efficacy/antiviral activity and safety of maraviroc.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Distribution Maraviroc is bound (approximately 76%) to human plasma proteins, and shows moderate affinity for albumin and alpha<U+2011>1 acid glycoprotein.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The volume of distribution of maraviroc is approximately 194 L. Elimination Metabolism: Trials in humans and in vitro studies using human liver microsomes and expressed enzymes have demonstrated that maraviroc is principally metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system to metabolites that are essentially inactive against HIV<U+2011>1.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In vitro studies indicate that CYP3A is the major enzyme responsible for maraviroc metabolism.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In vitro studies also indicate that polymorphic enzymes CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP2C19 do not contribute significantly to the metabolism of maraviroc.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Maraviroc is the major circulating component (~42% drug<U+2011>related radioactivity) following a single oral dose of 300 mg [14C]-maraviroc.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The most significant circulating metabolite in humans is a secondary amine (~22% radioactivity) formed by N<U+2011>dealkylation.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This polar metabolite has no significant pharmacological activity.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Other metabolites are products of mono<U+2011>oxidation and are only minor components of plasma drug<U+2011>related radioactivity.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Excretion: The terminal half<U+2011>life of maraviroc following oral dosing to steady state in healthy subjects was 14 to 18 hours.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A mass balance/excretion trial was conducted using a single 300<U+2011>mg dose of 14C-labeled maraviroc.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Approximately 20% of the radiolabel was recovered in the urine and 76% was recovered in the feces over 168 hours.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Maraviroc was the major component present in urine (mean of 8% dose) and feces (mean of 25% dose).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The remainder was excreted as metabolites.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Specific Populations Patients with Hepatic Impairment: Maraviroc is primarily metabolized and eliminated by the liver.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A trial compared the pharmacokinetics of a single 300<U+2011>mg dose of SELZENTRY in subjects with mild (Child<U+2011>Pugh Class A, n = 8) and moderate (Child<U+2011>Pugh Class B, n = 8) hepatic impairment with pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects (n = 8).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The mean Cmax and AUC were 11% and 25% higher, respectively, for subjects with mild hepatic impairment, and 32% and 46% higher, respectively, for subjects with moderate hepatic impairment compared with subjects with normal hepatic function.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These changes do not warrant a dose adjustment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Maraviroc concentrations are higher when SELZENTRY 150 mg is administered with a potent CYP3A inhibitor compared with following administration of 300 mg without a CYP3A inhibitor, so patients with moderate hepatic impairment who receive SELZENTRY 150 mg with a potent CYP3A inhibitor should be monitored closely for maraviroc<U+2011>associated adverse events.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The pharmacokinetics of maraviroc have not been studied in subjects with severe hepatic impairment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients with Renal Impairment: A trial compared the pharmacokinetics of a single 300<U+2011>mg dose of SELZENTRY in adult subjects with severe renal impairment (CrCl less than 30 mL per minute, n = 6) and ESRD (n = 6) with healthy volunteers (n = 6).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Geometric mean ratios for maraviroc Cmax and AUCinf were 2.4<U+2011>fold and 3.2<U+2011>fold higher, respectively, for subjects with severe renal impairment, and 1.7<U+2011>fold and 2.0<U+2011>fold higher, respectively, for subjects with ESRD as compared with subjects with normal renal function in this trial.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hemodialysis had a minimal effect on maraviroc clearance and exposure in subjects with ESRD.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Exposures observed in subjects with severe renal impairment and ESRD were within the range observed in previous 300<U+2011>mg single<U+2011>dose trials of SELZENTRY in healthy volunteers with normal renal function.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, maraviroc exposures in the subjects with normal renal function in this trial were 50% lower than those observed in previous trials.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Based on the results of this trial, no dose adjustment is recommended for patients with renal impairment receiving SELZENTRY without a potent CYP3A inhibitor or inducer.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, if patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD experience any symptoms of postural hypotension while taking SELZENTRY 300 mg twice daily, their dose should be reduced to 150 mg twice daily.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In addition, the trial compared the pharmacokinetics of multiple<U+2011>dose SELZENTRY in combination with saquinavir/ritonavir 1,000/100 mg twice daily (a potent CYP3A inhibitor combination) for 7 days in subjects with mild renal impairment (CrCl greater than 50 and less than or equal to 80 mL per minute, n = 6) and moderate renal impairment (CrCl greater than or equal to 30 and less than or equal to 50 mL per minute, n = 6) with healthy volunteers with normal renal function (n = 6).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Subjects received 150 mg of SELZENTRY at different dose frequencies (healthy volunteers <U+2013> every 12 hours; mild renal impairment <U+2013> every 24 hours; moderate renal impairment <U+2013> every 48 hours).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Compared with healthy volunteers (dosed every 12 hours), geometric mean ratios for maraviroc AUCtau, Cmax, and Cmin were 50% higher, 20% higher, and 43% lower, respectively, for subjects with mild renal impairment (dosed every 24 hours).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Geometric mean ratios for maraviroc AUCtau, Cmax, and Cmin were 16% higher, 29% lower, and 85% lower, respectively, for subjects with moderate renal impairment (dosed every 48 hours) compared with healthy volunteers (dosed every 12 hours).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Based on the data from this trial, no adjustment in dose is recommended for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Pediatric Patients: The pharmacokinetics of maraviroc were evaluated in CCR5-tropic, HIV-1<U+2013>infected, treatment-experienced pediatric subjects aged 2 to less than 18 years.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In the dose-finding stage of Trial A4001031, doses were administered with food on intensive PK evaluation days and optimized to achieve an average concentration over the dosing interval (Cavg) of greater than 100 ng per mL.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Throughout the trial, on non-intensive PK evaluation days maraviroc was taken with or without food.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The initial dose of maraviroc was based on BSA and concomitant medication category (i.e., presence of CYP3A inhibitors and/or inducers).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The conversion of dosing to a weight (kg)-band basis in children provides comparable exposures with those observed in the trial at the corresponding BSA.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Maraviroc pharmacokinetic parameters in pediatric subjects receiving potent CYP3A inhibitors with or without a potent CYP3A inducer (Table 12) and in subjects weighing greater than or equal to 30 kg and receiving noninteracting concomitant medications (Table 13) were similar to those observed in adults.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Insufficient pharmacokinetic data are available to make a comparison between adults and pediatric subjects weighing less than 30 kg and receiving noninteracting concomitant medications or between adult and pediatric subjects receiving concomitant medications consisting of a potent CYP3A inducer without CYP3A inhibitor.

Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Maraviroc does not induce CYP1A2 in vitro.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Additionally, in vitro studies have shown that maraviroc is not a substrate for, and does not inhibit, any of the major renal uptake inhibitors (organic anion transporter [OAT]1, OAT3, organic cation transporter [OCT]2, novel organic cation transporter [OCTN]1, and OCTN2) at clinically relevant concentrations.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In vitro results suggest that maraviroc could inhibit P-gp in the gut.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, maraviroc did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of digoxin in vivo, indicating maraviroc may not significantly inhibit or induce P-gp clinically.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Maraviroc had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam, the oral contraceptives ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel, no effect on the urinary 6<U+03B2>-hydroxycortisol/cortisol ratio, suggesting no induction of CYP3A in vivo.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Maraviroc had no effect on the debrisoquine metabolic ratio (MR) at 300 mg twice daily or less in vivo and did not cause inhibition of CYP2D6 in vitro until concentrations greater than 100 microM.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Mechanism of Action Maraviroc is a member of a therapeutic class called CCR5 co-receptor antagonists.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Maraviroc selectively binds to the human chemokine receptor CCR5 present on the cell membrane, preventing the interaction of HIV-1 gp120 and CCR5 necessary for CCR5-tropic HIV-1 to enter cells.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CXCR4-tropic and dual-tropic HIV-1 entry is not inhibited by maraviroc.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Antiviral Activity in Cell Culture Maraviroc inhibits the replication of CCR5-tropic laboratory strains and primary isolates of HIV-1 in models of acute peripheral blood leukocyte infection.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The mean EC50 value (50% effective concentration) for maraviroc against HIV-1 group M isolates (subtypes A to J and circulating recombinant form AE) and group O isolates ranged from 0.1 to 4.5 nM (0.05 to 2.3 ng per mL) in cell culture.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When used with other antiretroviral agents in cell culture, the combination of maraviroc was not antagonistic with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs: delavirdine, efavirenz, and nevirapine), NRTIs (abacavir, didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir, zalcitabine, and zidovudine), or protease inhibitors (PIs: amprenavir, atazanavir, darunavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, and tipranavir).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Maraviroc was not antagonistic with the HIV-1 gp41 fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Resistance in Cell Culture: HIV-1 variants with reduced susceptibility to maraviroc have been selected in cell culture following serial passage of 2 CCR5-tropic viruses (CCl/85 and RU570).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The maraviroc-resistant viruses remained CCR5-tropic with no evidence of a change from a CCR5-tropic virus to a CXCR4-using virus.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Two amino acid residue substitutions in the V3-loop region of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (gp160), A316T, and I323V (HXB2 numbering), were shown to be necessary for the maraviroc-resistant phenotype in the HIV-1 isolate CCl/85.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In the RU570 isolate a 3-amino acid residue deletion in the V3 loop, <U+0394>QAI (HXB2 positions 315 to 317), was associated with maraviroc resistance.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The relevance of the specific gp120 substitutions observed in maraviroc-resistant isolates selected in cell culture to clinical maraviroc resistance is not known.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Maraviroc-resistant viruses were characterized phenotypically by concentration-response curves that did not reach 100% inhibition in phenotypic drug assays, rather than increases in EC50 values.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cross-Resistance in Cell Culture: Maraviroc had antiviral activity against HIV<U+2011>1 clinical isolates resistant to NNRTIs, NRTIs, PIs, and the gp41 fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide in cell culture (EC50 values ranged from 0.7 to 8.9 nM [0.36 to 4.57 ng per mL]).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Maraviroc<U+2011>resistant viruses that emerged in cell culture remained susceptible to enfuvirtide and the protease inhibitor saquinavir.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Clinical Resistance: Virologic failure on maraviroc can result from genotypic and phenotypic resistance to maraviroc, through outgrowth of undetected CXCR4-using virus present before maraviroc treatment, through resistance to background therapy drugs (Table 15), or due to low exposure to maraviroc.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Antiretroviral Treatment-Experienced Adult Subjects (Trials A4001027 and A4001028): Week 48 data from treatment-experienced subjects failing maraviroc-containing regimens with CCR5-tropic virus (n = 58) have identified 22 viruses that had decreased susceptibility to maraviroc characterized in phenotypic drug assays by concentration-response curves that did not reach 100% inhibition.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Additionally, CCR5-tropic virus from 2 of these treatment-failure subjects had greater than or equal to 3-fold shifts in EC50 values for maraviroc at the time of failure.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Fifteen of these viruses were sequenced in the gp120 encoding region and multiple amino acid substitutions with unique patterns in the heterogeneous V3 loop region were detected.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Changes at either amino acid position 308 or 323 (HXB2 numbering) were seen in the V3 loop in 7 of the subjects with decreased maraviroc susceptibility.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Substitutions outside the V3 loop of gp120 may also contribute to reduced susceptibility to maraviroc.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Antiretroviral Treatment-Naive Adult Subjects (Trial A4001026): Treatment-naive subjects receiving SELZENTRY had more virologic failures and more treatment-emergent resistance to the background regimen drugs compared with those receiving efavirenz (Table 15).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	One additional subject had a greater than or equal to 3-fold shift in the EC50 value for maraviroc at the time of failure.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A clonal analysis of the V3 loop amino acid envelope sequences was performed from 6 of the 7 subjects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Changes in V3 loop amino acid sequence differed between each of these different subjects, even for those infected with the same virus clade, suggesting that there are multiple diverse pathways to maraviroc resistance.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The subjects who failed with CCR5-tropic virus and without a detectable maraviroc shift in susceptibility were not evaluated for genotypic resistance.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Of the 32 maraviroc virologic failures failing with CCR5-tropic virus, 20 (63%) also had genotypic and/or phenotypic resistance to background drugs in the regimen (lamivudine, zidovudine).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Tropism: In both treatment-experienced and treatment-naive subjects, detection of CXCR4-using virus prior to initiation of therapy has been associated with a reduced virologic response to maraviroc.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Antiretroviral Treatment<U+2011>Experienced Subjects (Trials A4001027 and A4001028): In the majority of cases, treatment failure on maraviroc was associated with detection of CXCR4-using virus (i.e., CXCR4- or dual/mixed-tropic) which was not detected by the tropism assay prior to treatment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CXCR4-using virus was detected at failure in approximately 55% of subjects who failed treatment on maraviroc by Week 48, as compared with 9% of subjects who experienced treatment failure in the placebo arm.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	To investigate the likely origin of the on-treatment CXCR4-using virus, a detailed clonal analysis was conducted on virus from 20 representative subjects (16 subjects from the maraviroc arms and 4 subjects from the placebo arm) in whom CXCR4-using virus was detected at treatment failure.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	From analysis of amino acid sequence differences and phylogenetic data, it was determined that CXCR4-using virus in these subjects emerged from a low level of pre-existing CXCR4-using virus not detected by the tropism assay (which is population-based) prior to treatment rather than from a co-receptor switch from CCR5-tropic virus to CXCR4-using virus resulting from mutation in the virus.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Detection of CXCR4-using virus prior to initiation of therapy has been associated with a reduced virological response to maraviroc.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Furthermore, subjects failing twice-daily maraviroc at Week 48 with CXCR4-using virus had a lower median increase in CD4+ cell counts from baseline (+41 cells per mm3) than those subjects failing with CCR5-tropic virus (+162 cells per mm3).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The median increase in CD4+ cell count in subjects failing in the placebo arm was +7 cells per mm3.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Antiretroviral Treatment<U+2011>Naive Subjects (Trial A4001026): In a 96-week trial of antiretroviral treatment-naive subjects, 14% (12 of 85) who had only CCR5-tropic virus at screening with an enhanced sensitivity tropism assay (TROFILE) and failed therapy on maraviroc had CXCR4-using virus at the time of treatment failure.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A detailed clonal analysis was conducted in 2 previously antiretroviral treatment-naive subjects enrolled in a Phase 2a monotherapy trial who had CXCR4-using virus detected after 10 days<U+2019> treatment with maraviroc.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Consistent with the detailed clonal analysis conducted in treatment-experienced subjects, the CXCR4-using variants appear to emerge from outgrowth of a pre-existing undetected CXCR4-using virus.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Screening with an enhanced sensitivity tropism assay reduced the number of maraviroc virologic failures with CXCR4- or dual/mixed-tropic virus at failure to 12 compared with 24 when screening with the original tropism assay.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	All but one (11 of 12; 92%) of the maraviroc failures failing with CXCR4 or dual/mixed-tropic virus also had genotypic and phenotypic resistance to the background drug lamivudine at failure and 33% (4 of 12) developed zidovudine-associated resistance substitutions.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Subjects who had only CCR5-tropic virus at baseline and failed maraviroc therapy with CXCR4-using virus had a median increase in CD4+ cell counts from baseline of +113 cells per mm3 while those subjects failing with CCR5-tropic virus had an increase of +135 cells per mm3.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The median increase in CD4+ cell count in subjects failing in the efavirenz arm was +95 cells per mm3.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Antiretroviral Treatment-Experienced Pediatric Subjects (Trial A4001031): In the Week 48 analysis of Trial A4001031 (n = 103), the mechanisms of resistance to maraviroc observed in the treatment-experienced pediatric population were similar to those observed in adult populations: reasons for virologic failure included failing with CXCR4- or dual/mixed-tropic virus, evidence of reduced maraviroc susceptibility as measured by a decrease in maximal percentage inhibition (MPI), and emergence of resistance to background drug in the regimen.

5	Hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (i.e., decreased serum bicarbonate below the normal reference range in the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis) is associated with topiramate treatment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This metabolic acidosis is caused by renal bicarbonate loss due to the inhibitory effect of topiramate on carbonic anhydrase.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Such electrolyte imbalance has been observed with the use of topiramate in placebo-controlled clinical trials and in the post-marketing period.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Generally, topiramate-induced metabolic acidosis occurs early in treatment although cases can occur at any time during treatment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Bicarbonate decrements are usually mild-moderate (average decrease of 4 mEq/L at daily doses of 400 mg in adults and at approximately 6 mg/kg/day in pediatric patients); rarely, patients can experience severe decrements to values below 10 mEq/L.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Conditions or therapies that predispose patients to acidosis (such as renal disease, severe respiratory disorders, status epilepticus, diarrhea, ketogenic diet or specific drugs) may be additive to the bicarbonate lowering effects of topiramate.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Manifestations of Metabolic Acidosis Some manifestations of acute or chronic metabolic acidosis may include hyperventilation, nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and anorexia, or more severe sequelae including cardiac arrhythmias or stupor.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Chronic, untreated metabolic acidosis may increase the risk for nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis, and may also result in osteomalacia (referred to as rickets in pediatric patients) and/or osteoporosis with an increased risk for fractures.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Chronic metabolic acidosis in pediatric patients may also reduce growth rates.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A reduction in growth rate may eventually decrease the maximal height achieved.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effect of topiramate on growth and bone-related sequelae has not been systematically investigated in long-term, placebo-controlled trials.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Long-term, open-label treatment of infants/toddlers, with intractable partial epilepsy, for up to 1 year, showed reductions from baseline in Z SCORES for length, weight, and head circumference compared to age and sex-matched normative data, although these patients are likely to have different growth rates than normal infants.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Reductions in Z SCORES for length and weight were correlated to the degree of acidosis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Topiramate treatment that causes metabolic acidosis during pregnancy can possibly produce adverse effects on the fetus and might also cause metabolic acidosis in the neonate from possible transfer of topiramate to the fetus.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Epilepsy Adult Patients In adults, the incidence of persistent decreases in serum bicarbonate (levels of less than 20 mEq/L at two consecutive visits or at the final visit) in controlled clinical trials for adjunctive treatment of epilepsy was 32% for 400 mg per day, and 1% for placebo.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Metabolic acidosis has been observed at doses as low as 50 mg per day.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The incidence of a markedly abnormally low serum bicarbonate (i.e., absolute value less than 17 mEq/L and greater than 5 mEq/L decrease from pretreatment) in the adjunctive therapy trials was 3% for 400 mg per day and 0% for placebo.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The incidence of persistent decreases in serum bicarbonate in adult patients (<U+2265>16 years of age) in the epilepsy controlled clinical trial for monotherapy was 14% for 50 mg per day and 25% for 400 mg per day.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The incidence of a markedly abnormally low serum bicarbonate (i.e., absolute value less than 17 mEq/L and greater than 5 mEq/L decrease from pretreatment) in this trial for adults was 1% for 50 mg per day and 6% for 400 mg per day.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Serum bicarbonate levels have not been systematically evaluated at daily doses greater than 400 mg per day.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Pediatric Patients (2 years to 16 years of age) The incidence of persistent decreases in serum bicarbonate in placebo-controlled trials for adjunctive treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or refractory partial onset seizures in patients age 2 years to 16 years was 67% for topiramate (at approximately 6 mg/kg/day), and 10% for placebo.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The incidence of a markedly abnormally low serum bicarbonate (i.e., absolute value less than 17 mEq/L and greater than 5 mEq/L decrease from pretreatment) in these trials was 11% for topiramate and 0% for placebo.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cases of moderately severe metabolic acidosis have been reported in patients as young as 5 months old, especially at daily doses above 5 mg/kg/day.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In pediatric patients (6 years to 15 years of age), the incidence of persistent decreases in serum bicarbonate in the epilepsy controlled clinical trial for monotherapy performed with topiramate was 9% for 50 mg per day and 25% for 400 mg per day.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The incidence of a markedly abnormally low serum bicarbonate (i.e., absolute value less than 17 mEq/L and greater than 5 mEq/L decrease from pretreatment) in this trial was 1% for 50 mg per day and 6% for 400 mg per day.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Pediatric Patients (under 2 years of age) Although QUDEXY XR is not approved for use in patients less than 2 years of age, a study of topiramate as adjunctive use in patients under 2 years of age with partial onset seizures revealed that topiramate produced a metabolic acidosis that is notably greater in magnitude than that observed in controlled trials in older children and adults.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The mean treatment difference (25 mg/kg/day topiramate-placebo) was -5.9 mEq/L for bicarbonate.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The incidence of metabolic acidosis (defined by a serum bicarbonate less than 20 mEq/L) was 0% for placebo, 30% for 5 mg/kg/day, 50% for 15 mg/kg/day, and 45% for 25 mg/kg/day.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The incidence of markedly abnormal changes (i.e., less than 17 mEq/L and greater than 5 mEq/L decrease from baseline of greater than or equal to 20 mEq/L) was 0% for placebo, 4% for 5 mg/kg/day, 5% for 15 mg/kg/day and 5% for 25 mg/kg/day.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Migraine Adult Patients The incidence of persistent decreases in serum bicarbonate in placebo-controlled trials in adults for the prophylaxis of migraine was 44% for 200 mg/day, 39% for 100 mg/day, 23% for 50 mg/day, and 7% for placebo.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The incidence of markedly abnormally low serum bicarbonate (i.e., absolute value less than 17 mEq/L and greater than 5 mEq/L decrease from pretreatment) in these trials was 11% for 200 mg/day, 9% for 100 mg/day, 2% for 50 mg/day, and <1% for placebo.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Adolescent Patients In pooled, double-blind migraine prophylaxis studies in adolescent patients (12 to 17 years of age), the incidence of persistent decreases in serum bicarbonate was 77% for 200 mg/day, 27% for 100 mg/day, 30% for 50 mg/day, and 9% for placebo.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The incidence of markedly low serum bicarbonate (i.e., absolute value <17 mEq/L and >5 mEq/L decrease from pretreatment) was 6% for 100 mg/day, 2% for 50 mg/day, and 2% for placebo.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This bicarbonate criterion was not met by any patients in the 200 mg/day group, which had a low number of subjects (n=13).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Measurement of Serum Bicarbonate in Epilepsy and Migraine Patients Measurement of baseline and periodic serum bicarbonate during topiramate treatment is recommended.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If metabolic acidosis develops and persists, consideration should be given to reducing the dose or discontinuing topiramate (using dose tapering).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If the decision is made to continue patients on topiramate in the face of persistent acidosis, alkali treatment should be considered.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients treated with any AED, including QUDEXY XR, for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Table 4 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Table 4: Risk by Indication for Antiepileptic Drugs in the Pooled Analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events per 1,000 Patients Drug Patients with Events per 1,000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/ Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events per 1,000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Anyone considering prescribing QUDEXY XR or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior or thoughts about self-harm.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Adverse reactions most often associated with the use of topiramate, and therefore expected to be associated with the use of QUDEXY XR, were related to the central nervous system and were observed in both the epilepsy and migraine populations.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In adults, the most frequent of these can be classified into three general categories: 1) Cognitive-related dysfunction (e.g. confusion, psychomotor slowing, difficulty with concentration/attention, difficulty with memory, speech or language problems, particularly word-finding difficulties), 2) Psychiatric/behavioral disturbances (e.g. depression or mood problems), and 3) Somnolence or fatigue.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Adult Patients Cognitive Related Dysfunction The majority of cognitive-related adverse reactions were mild to moderate in severity, and they frequently occurred in isolation.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rapid titration rate and higher initial dose were associated with higher incidences of these reactions.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Many of these reactions contributed to withdrawal from treatment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In the adjunctive epilepsy controlled trials conducted with topiramate (using rapid titration such as 100 mg per day to 200 mg per day weekly increments), the proportion of patients who experienced one or more cognitive-related adverse reactions was 42% for 200 mg per day, 41% for 400 mg per day, 52% for 600 mg per day, 56% for 800 and 1,000 mg per day, and 14% for placebo.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These dose-related adverse reactions began with a similar frequency in the titration or in the maintenance phase, although in some patients the events began during titration and persisted into the maintenance phase.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Some patients who experienced one or more cognitive-related adverse reactions in the titration phase had a dose-related recurrence of these reactions in the maintenance phase.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In the monotherapy epilepsy controlled trial conducted with topiramate, the proportion of patients who experienced one or more cognitive-related adverse reactions was 19% for topiramate 50 mg per day and 26% for 400 mg per day.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In the 6-month migraine prophylaxis controlled trials using a slower titration regimen (25 mg/day weekly increments), the proportion of patients who experienced one or more cognitive-related adverse reactions was 19% for topiramate 50 mg/day, 22% for 100 mg/day (the recommended dose), 28% for 200 mg/day, and 10% for placebo.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These dose-related adverse reactions typically began in the titration phase and often persisted into the maintenance phase, but infrequently began in the maintenance phase.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Some patients experienced a recurrence of one or more of these cognitive adverse reactions and this recurrence was typically in the titration phase.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A relatively small proportion of topiramate-treated patients experienced more than one concurrent cognitive adverse reaction.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The most common cognitive adverse reactions occurring together included difficulty with memory along with difficulty with concentration/attention, difficulty with memory along with language problems, and difficulty with concentration/attention along with language problems.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rarely, topiramate-treated patients experienced three concurrent cognitive reactions.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Psychiatric/Behavioral Disturbances Psychiatric/behavioral disturbances (depression or mood) were dose-related for both the epilepsy and migraine populations treated with topiramate.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Somnolence/Fatigue Somnolence and fatigue were the adverse reactions most frequently reported during clinical trials of topiramate for adjunctive epilepsy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For the adjunctive epilepsy population, the incidence of somnolence did not differ substantially between 200 mg per day and 1,000 mg per day, but the incidence of fatigue was dose-related and increased at dosages above 400 mg per day.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For the monotherapy epilepsy population in the 50 mg per day and 400 mg per day groups, the incidence of somnolence was dose-related (9% for the 50 mg per day group and 15% for the 400 mg per day group) and the incidence of fatigue was comparable in both treatment groups (14% each).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For the migraine population, somnolence and fatigue were dose-related and more common in the titration phase.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Additional nonspecific CNS events commonly observed with topiramate in the adjunctive epilepsy population include dizziness or ataxia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Pediatric Patients Epilepsy In double-blind adjunctive therapy and monotherapy epilepsy clinical studies conducted with topiramate, the incidences of cognitive/neuropsychiatric adverse reactions in pediatric patients were generally lower than observed in adults.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These reactions included psychomotor slowing, difficulty with concentration/attention, speech disorders/related speech problems and language problems.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The most frequently reported neuropsychiatric reactions in pediatric patients during adjunctive therapy double-blind studies were somnolence and fatigue.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The most frequently reported neuropsychiatric reactions in pediatric patients in the 50 mg per day and 400 mg per day groups during the monotherapy double-blind study were headache, dizziness, anorexia, and somnolence.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	No patients discontinued treatment due to any adverse reactions in the adjunctive epilepsy double-blind trials.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In the monotherapy epilepsy double-blind trial conducted with immediate-release topiramate product, 1 pediatric patient (2%) in the 50 mg per day group and 7 pediatric patients (12%) in the 400 mg per day group discontinued treatment due to any adverse reactions.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The most common adverse reaction associated with discontinuation of therapy was difficulty with concentration/attention; all occurred in the 400 mg per day group.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Migraine The incidence of cognitive adverse reactions was increased in topiramate-treated patients (7%) versus placebo (4%) in pooled, double-blind placebo-controlled studies in which adolescent patients (12 to 17 years) were randomized to placebo or one of several fixed daily doses of topiramate (50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The incidence of cognitive adverse reactions was also increased in a placebo-controlled study of pediatric patients (6 to 16 years) treated with 2 to 3 mg/kg/day of topiramate (10%) versus placebo treatment (2%).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	QUDEXY XR is not approved for prophylaxis of migraine in pediatric patients under 12 years of age.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The risk for cognitive adverse reactions was dose-dependent, and was particularly evident at the 200 mg dose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This risk for cognitive adverse reactions was also greater in younger patients (6 to 11 years) than in older patients (12 to 17 years).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The most common cognitive adverse reaction in these trials was difficulty with concentration/attention.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cognitive adverse reactions most commonly developed in the titration period and sometimes persisted into the maintenance period.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These adverse reactions typically occurred in isolation as single type of cognitive adverse reaction.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cognitive adverse reactions that led to study discontinuation occurred in one patient (difficulty with concentration/attention and language problems).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) was administered to adolescents (12 to 17 years) to assess the effects of topiramate on cognitive function at baseline and at the end of the Study 3.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Mean change from baseline in certain CANTAB tests suggests that topiramate treatment may result in psychomotor slowing and decreased verbal fluency.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Topiramate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Data from pregnancy registries indicate that infants exposed to topiramate in utero have an increased risk for cleft lip and/or cleft palate (oral clefts) and for being small for gestational age.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In multiple species, oral administration of topiramate to pregnant animals at clinically relevant doses resulted in structural malformations, including craniofacial defects, and reduced body weights in offspring.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Consider the benefits and risks of QUDEXY XR when administering the drug in women of childbearing potential, particularly when QUDEXY XR is considered for a condition not usually associated with permanent injury or death.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	QUDEXY XR should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be informed of the potential hazard to a fetus.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In patients with or without a history of seizures or epilepsy, antiepileptic drugs including QUDEXY XR, should be gradually withdrawn to minimize the potential for seizures or increased seizure frequency.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In situations where rapid withdrawal of QUDEXY XR is medically required, appropriate monitoring is recommended.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hyperammonemia/Encephalopathy Without Concomitant Valproic Acid (VPA) Topiramate treatment has produced hyperammonemia (in some instances dose-related) in a clinical investigational program in adolescent patients (12 to 17 years) who were treated with topiramate for migraine prophylaxis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The incidence of hyperammonemia (above the upper limit of normal reference) at any time in the trial was 9% for placebo, 14% for 50 mg, and 26% for 100 mg topiramate daily.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In some patients, hyperammonemia was observed at the end of the trial at the final visit.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The incidence of markedly increased hyperammonemia (at least 50% or higher above upper limit of normal) at any time in the trial in adolescent patients was also increased at 100 mg/day (9%) compared to 50 mg topiramate (0%) or placebo (3%).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During this trial, markedly increased ammonia levels returned to normal in all but one patient (in whom the ammonia level fell to high instead of markedly abnormal).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Topiramate treatment has produced hyperammonemia in a clinical investigational program in very young pediatric patients (1 month to 24 months) who were treated with adjunctive topiramate for partial onset epilepsy (8% for placebo, 10% for 5 mg/kg/day, 0% for 15 mg/kg/day, 9% for 25 mg/kg/day).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	QUDEXY XR is not approved as adjunctive treatment of partial onset seizures in pediatric patients less than 2 years old.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In some patients, ammonia was markedly increased (greater than 50% above upper limit of normal).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The hyperammonemia associated with topiramate treatment occurred with and without encephalopathy in placebo-controlled trials, and in an open-label, extension trial of infants with refractory epilepsy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dose-related hyperammonemia was also observed in the extension trial in pediatric patients up to 2 years old.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Clinical symptoms of hyperammonemic encephalopathy often include acute alterations in level of consciousness and/or cognitive function with lethargy or vomiting.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hyperammonemia with and without encephalopathy has also been observed in post-marketing reports in patients who were taking topiramate without concomitant valproic acid (VPA).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hyperammonemia/Encephalopathy With Concomitant Valproic Acid (VPA) Concomitant administration of topiramate and valproic acid (VPA) has been associated with hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy in patients who have tolerated either drug alone based upon post-marketing reports.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Although hyperammonemia may be asymptomatic, clinical symptoms of hyperammonemic encephalopathy often include acute alterations in level of consciousness and/or cognitive function with lethargy or vomiting.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In most cases, symptoms and signs abated with discontinuation of either drug.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This adverse reaction is not due to a pharmacokinetic interaction.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Although QUDEXY XR is not indicated for use in infants/toddlers (1 month to 24 months), topiramate with concomitant VPA clearly produced a dose-related increase in the incidence of hyperammonemia (above the upper limit of normal, 0% for placebo, 12% for 5 mg/kg/day, 7% for 15 mg/kg/day, 17% for 25 mg/kg/day) in an investigational program using topiramate.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Markedly increased, dose-related hyperammonemia (0% for placebo and 5 mg/kg/day, 7% for 15 mg/kg/day, and 8% for 25 mg/kg/day) also occurred in these infants/toddlers.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dose-related hyperammonemia was similarly observed in a long-term, extension trial utilizing topiramate in these very young, pediatric patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hyperammonemia with and without encephalopathy has also been observed in post-marketing reports in patients taking topiramate with valproic acid (VPA).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The hyperammonemia associated with topiramate treatment appears to be more common when used concomitantly with VPA.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Monitoring for Hyperammonemia Patients with inborn errors of metabolism or reduced hepatic mitochondrial activity may be at an increased risk for hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Although not studied, topiramate or QUDEXY XR treatment or an interaction of concomitant topiramate-based product and valproic acid treatment may exacerbate existing defects or unmask deficiencies in susceptible persons.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In patients who develop unexplained lethargy, vomiting, or changes in mental status associated with any topiramate treatment, hyperammonemic encephalopathy should be considered and an ammonia level should be measured.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A total of 32/2086 (1.5%) of adults exposed to topiramate during its adjunctive epilepsy therapy development reported the occurrence of kidney stones, an incidence about 2 to 4 times greater than expected in a similar, untreated population.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In the double-blind monotherapy epilepsy study, a total of 4/319 (1.3%) of adults exposed to topiramate reported the occurrence of kidney stones.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	As in the general population, the incidence of stone formation among topiramate-treated patients was higher in men.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Kidney stones have also been reported in pediatric patients taking topiramate for epilepsy or migraine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During long-term (up to 1 year) topiramate treatment in an open-label extension study of 284 pediatric patients 1 month to 24 months old with epilepsy, 7% developed kidney or bladder stones that were diagnosed clinically or by sonogram.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	QUDEXY XR is not approved for pediatric patients less than 2 years old.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Kidney stones have also been reported in pediatric patients taking topiramate for migraine prophylaxis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For the double-blind migraine prophylaxis studies, one adverse event (renal calculus) occurred in a topiramate-treated subject in the age 12 to 17 years group.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The overall experience with open-label, long-term, topiramate treatment for migraine prophylaxis is limited in pediatric patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	QUDEXY XR would be expected to have the same effect as topiramate on the formation of kidney stones.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An explanation for the association of topiramate and kidney stones may lay in the fact that topiramate is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g., zonisamide, acetazolamide or dichlorphenamide) can promote stone formation by reducing urinary citrate excretion and by increasing urinary pH.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The concomitant use of QUDEXY XR with any other drug producing metabolic acidosis, or potentially in patients on a ketogenic diet, may create a physiological environment that increases the risk of kidney stone formation, and should therefore be avoided.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Increased fluid intake increases the urinary output, lowering the concentration of substances involved in stone formation.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hydration is recommended to reduce new stone formation.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hypothermia, defined as an unintentional drop in body core temperature to less than 35<U+00BA>C (95<U+00BA>F) has been reported in association with topiramate use with concomitant valproic acid (VPA) both in the presence and in the absence of hyperammonemia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This adverse reaction in patients using concomitant topiramate and valproate can occur after starting topiramate treatment or after increasing the daily dose of topiramate.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Consideration should be given to stopping topiramate or valproate in patients who develop hypothermia, which may be manifested by a variety of clinical abnormalities including lethargy, confusion, coma, and significant alterations in other major organ systems such as the cardiovascular and respiratory systems.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Clinical management and assessment should include examination of blood ammonia levels.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Paresthesia (usually tingling of the extremities), an effect associated with the use of other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, appears to be a common effect of topiramate in adult and pediatric patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Paresthesia was more frequently reported in the monotherapy epilepsy trials and migraine prophylaxis trials conducted with immediate-release topiramate than in the adjunctive therapy epilepsy trials conducted with the same product.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In the majority of instances, paresthesia did not lead to treatment discontinuation.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients should be watched carefully when QUDEXY XR is co-administered with other CNS depressant drugs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The precise mechanisms by which topiramate exerts its anticonvulsant and migraine prophylaxis effects are unknown; however, preclinical studies have revealed four properties that may contribute to topiramate's efficacy for epilepsy and migraine prophylaxis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Electrophysiological and biochemical evidence suggests that topiramate, at pharmacologically relevant concentrations, blocks voltage-dependent sodium channels, augments the activity of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyrate at some subtypes of the GABA-A receptor, antagonizes the AMPA/kainate subtype of the glutamate receptor, and inhibits the carbonic anhydrase enzyme, particularly isozymes II and IV.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Topiramate has anticonvulsant activity in rat and mouse maximal electroshock seizure (MES) tests.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Topiramate is only weakly effective in blocking clonic seizures induced by the GABA-A receptor antagonist, pentylenetetrazole.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Topiramate is also effective in rodent models of epilepsy, which include tonic and absence-like seizures in the spontaneous epileptic rat (SER) and tonic and clonic seizures induced in rats by kindling of the amygdala or by global ischemia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Changes (increases and decreases) from baseline in vital signs (systolic blood pressure-SBP, diastolic blood pressure-DBP, pulse) occurred more frequently in pediatric patients (6 to 17 years) treated with various daily doses of topiramate (50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 2 to 3 mg/kg) than in patients treated with placebo in controlled trials for migraine prophylaxis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The most notable changes were SBP < 90 mm Hg, DBP < 50 mm Hg, SBP or DBP increases or decreases <U+2265> 20 mm Hg, and pulse increases or decreases <U+2265> 30 beats per minute.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These changes were often dose-related, and were most frequently associated with the greatest treatment difference at the 200 mg dose level.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When a position was specified for measurement of vital signs in a trial, measurements were made in a sitting position.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Systematic collection of orthostatic vital signs has not been conducted.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The clinical significance of these various changes in vital signs has not been clearly established.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Absorption and Distribution The pharmacokinetics of QUDEXY XR are linear with dose proportional increases in plasma concentration when administered as a single oral dose over the range of 50 mg to 1,400 mg. At 25 mg, the pharmacokinetics of QUDEXY XR are nonlinear, possibly due to the binding of topiramate to carbonic anhydrase in red blood cells.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	QUDEXY XR sprinkled on a spoonful of soft food is bioequivalent to the intact capsule formulation.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Following a single 200 mg oral dose of QUDEXY XR, peak plasma concentrations (Tmax) occurred approximately 20 hours after dosing.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Steady-state was reached in about 5 days following daily dosing of QUDEXY XR in subjects with normal renal function, with a Tmax of approximately 6 hours.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	At steady-state, the plasma exposure (AUC0-24hr, Cmax, and Cmin) of topiramate from QUDEXY XR administered once daily and the immediate-release topiramate tablets administered twice-daily were shown to be bioequivalent.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Fluctuation of topiramate plasma concentrations at steady-state for QUDEXY XR administered once daily was approximately 40% in healthy subjects, compared to approximately 53% for immediate-release topiramate.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Topiramate is 15% to 41% bound to human plasma proteins over the blood concentration range of 0.5 mcg/mL to 250 mcg/mL.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The fraction bound decreased as blood concentration increased.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Carbamazepine and phenytoin do not alter the binding of immediate-release topiramate.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Sodium valproate, at 500 mcg/mL (a concentration 5 to 10 times higher than considered therapeutic for valproate) decreased the protein binding of immediate-release topiramate from 23% to 13%.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Immediate-release topiramate does not influence the binding of sodium valproate.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Metabolism and Excretion Topiramate is not extensively metabolized and is primarily eliminated unchanged in the urine (approximately 70% of an administered dose).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Six metabolites have been identified in humans, none of which constitutes more than 5% of an administered dose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The metabolites are formed via hydroxylation, hydrolysis, and glucuronidation.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There is evidence of renal tubular reabsorption of topiramate.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In rats, given probenecid to inhibit tubular reabsorption, along with topiramate, a significant increase in renal clearance of topiramate was observed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This interaction has not been evaluated in humans.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Overall, oral plasma clearance (CL/F) is approximately 20 mL/min to 30 mL/min in adults following oral administration.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The mean effective half-life of QUDEXY XR is approximately 56 hours.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Steady-state is reached in about 5 days after QUDEXY XR dosing in subjects with normal renal function.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Specific Populations Renal Impairment The clearance of topiramate was reduced by 42% in subjects with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 to 69 mL/min/1.73 m2) and by 54% in subjects with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) compared to subjects with normal renal function (creatinine clearance greater than70 mL/min/1.73 m2).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Since topiramate is presumed to undergo significant tubular reabsorption, it is uncertain whether this experience can be generalized to all situations of renal impairment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is conceivable that some forms of renal disease could differentially affect glomerular filtration rate and tubular reabsorption resulting in a clearance of topiramate not predicted by creatinine clearance.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In general, however, use of one-half the usual starting and maintenance dose is recommended in patients with creatinine clearance less than 70 mL/min/1.73 m2.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hemodialysis Topiramate is cleared by hemodialysis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Using a high-efficiency, counterflow, single pass-dialysate hemodialysis procedure, topiramate dialysis clearance was 120 mL/min with blood flow through the dialyzer at 400 mL/min.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This high clearance (compared to 20 mL/min to 30 mL/min total oral clearance in healthy adults) will remove a clinically significant amount of topiramate from the patient over the hemodialysis treatment period.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, a supplemental dose may be required.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hepatic Impairment In subjects with hepatic impairment, the clearance of topiramate may be decreased; the mechanism underlying the decrease is not well understood.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Age, Gender and Race The pharmacokinetics of topiramate in elderly subjects (65 to 85 years of age, N=16) were evaluated in a controlled clinical study.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The elderly subject population had reduced renal function (creatinine clearance [-20%]) compared to young adults.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Following a single oral 100 mg dose, maximum plasma concentration for elderly and young adults was achieved at approximately 1 to 2 hours.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Reflecting the primary renal elimination of topiramate, topiramate plasma and renal clearance were reduced 21% and 19%, respectively, in elderly subjects, compared to young adults.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Similarly, topiramate half-life was longer (13%) in the elderly.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Reduced topiramate clearance resulted in slightly higher maximum plasma concentration (23%) and AUC (25%) in elderly subjects than observed in young adults.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Topiramate clearance is decreased in the elderly only to the extent that renal function is reduced.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because of this, dosage adjustment may be necessary.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Clearance of topiramate in adults was not affected by gender or race.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Pediatric Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetics of immediate-release topiramate were evaluated in patients ages 2 years to less than 16 years.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients received either no or a combination of other antiepileptic drugs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A population pharmacokinetic model was developed on the basis of pharmacokinetic data from relevant topiramate clinical studies.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This dataset contained data from 1217 subjects including 258 pediatric patients aged 2 years to less than 16 years (95 pediatric patients less than 10 years of age).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In comparison, topiramate clearance per kg is greater in pediatric patients than in adults and in young pediatric patients (down to 2 years) than in older pediatric patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Consequently, the plasma drug concentration for the same mg/kg/day dose would be lower in pediatric patients compared to adults and also in younger pediatric patients compared to older pediatric patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drug-Drug Interaction Studies Antiepileptic Drugs Potential interactions between immediate-release topiramate and standard AEDs were assessed in controlled clinical pharmacokinetic studies in patients with epilepsy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effects of these interactions on mean plasma AUCs are summarized in Table 14.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Interaction of QUDEXY XR and standard AEDs is not expected to differ from the experience with immediate-release topiramate products.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In Table 14, the second column (AED concentration) describes what happened to the concentration of the AED listed in the first column when topiramate was added.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The third column (topiramate concentration) describes how the co-administration of a drug listed in the first column modified the concentration of topiramate in experimental settings when topiramate was given alone.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CNS Depressants or Alcohol Concomitant administration of topiramate and alcohol or other CNS depressant drugs has not been evaluated in clinical studies.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Oral Contraceptives In a pharmacokinetic interaction study in healthy volunteers with a concomitantly administered combination oral contraceptive product containing 1 mg norethindrone (NET) plus 35 mcg ethinyl estradiol (EE), topiramate, given in the absence of other medications at doses of 50 to 200 mg per day, was not associated with statistically significant changes in mean exposure (AUC) to either component of the oral contraceptive.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In another study, exposure to EE was statistically significantly decreased at doses of 200, 400, and 800 mg per day (18%, 21%, and 30%, respectively) when given as adjunctive therapy in patients taking valproic acid.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In both studies, topiramate (50 mg per day to 800 mg per day) did not significantly affect exposure to NET.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Although there was a dose-dependent decrease in EE exposure for doses between 200 to 800 mg per day, there was no significant dose-dependent change in EE exposure for doses of 50 to 200 mg per day.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The clinical significance of the changes observed is not known.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The possibility of decreased contraceptive efficacy and increased breakthrough bleeding should be considered in patients taking combination oral contraceptive products with QUDEXY XR.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The clinical relevance of this observation has not been established.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hydrochlorothiazide A drug-drug interaction study conducted in healthy volunteers evaluated the steady-state pharmacokinetics of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) (25 mg every 24 hours) and topiramate (96 mg every 12 hours) when administered alone and concomitantly.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The clinical significance of this change is unknown.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The addition of HCTZ to QUDEXY XR therapy may require an adjustment of the QUDEXY XR dose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The steady-state pharmacokinetics of HCTZ were not significantly influenced by the concomitant administration of topiramate.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Clinical laboratory results indicated decreases in serum potassium after topiramate or HCTZ administration, which were greater when HCTZ and topiramate were administered in combination.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Metformin Topiramate treatment can frequently cause metabolic acidosis, a condition for which the use of metformin is contraindicated.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	QUDEXY XR is expected to exhibit the same degree of metabolic acidosis as topiramate.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A drug-drug interaction study conducted in healthy volunteers evaluated the steady-state pharmacokinetics of metformin (500 mg every 12 hr) and topiramate in plasma when metformin was given alone and when metformin and topiramate (100 mg every 12 hr) were given simultaneously.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Topiramate did not affect metformin Tmax.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The clinical significance of the effect of topiramate on metformin pharmacokinetics is not known.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Oral plasma clearance of topiramate appears to be reduced when administered with metformin.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The clinical significance of the effect of metformin on topiramate QUDEXY XR pharmacokinetics is unclear.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Pioglitazone A drug-drug interaction study conducted in healthy volunteers evaluated the steady-state pharmacokinetics of topiramate and pioglitazone when administered alone and concomitantly.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This finding was not statistically significant.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The clinical significance of these findings is not known.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When QUDEXY XR is added to pioglitazone therapy or pioglitazone is added to QUDEXY XR therapy, careful attention should be given to the routine monitoring of patients for adequate control of their diabetic disease state.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Glyburide A drug-drug interaction study conducted in patients with type 2 diabetes evaluated the steady-state pharmacokinetics of glyburide (5 mg per day) alone and concomitantly with topiramate (150 mg per day).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The steady-state pharmacokinetics of topiramate were unaffected by concomitant administration of glyburide.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Haloperidol The pharmacokinetics of a single dose of haloperidol (5 mg) were not affected following multiple dosing of topiramate (100 mg every 12 hr) in 13 healthy adults (6 males, 7 females).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Sumatriptan Multiple dosing of topiramate (100 mg every 12 hrs) in 24 healthy volunteers (14 males, 10 females) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of single-dose sumatriptan either orally (100 mg) or subcutaneously (6 mg).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	No alterations of 9-hydroxyrisperidone levels were observed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There were no clinically significant changes in the systemic exposure of risperidone plus 9- hydroxyrisperidone or of topiramate; therefore, this interaction is not likely to be of clinical significance.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Propranolol Multiple dosing of topiramate (200 mg per day) in 34 healthy volunteers (17 males, 17 females) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of propranolol following daily 160 mg doses.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Propranolol doses of 160 mg per day in 39 volunteers (27 males, 12 females) had no effect on the exposure to topiramate at a dose of 200 mg per day of topiramate.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dihydroergotamine Multiple dosing of topiramate (200 mg per day) in 24 healthy volunteers (12 males, 12 females) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of a 1 mg subcutaneous dose of dihydroergotamine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Similarly, a 1 mg subcutaneous dose of dihydroergotamine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of a 200 mg per day dose of topiramate in the same study.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Venlafaxine Multiple dosing of topiramate (150 mg per day) in healthy volunteers did not affect the pharmacokinetics of venlafaxine or O-desmethyl venlafaxine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Multiple dosing of venlafaxine (150 mg) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of topiramate.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Other Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors Concomitant use of QUDEXY XR, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, with any other carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (e.g., zonisamide, acetazolamide, or dichlorphenamide), may increase the severity of metabolic acidosis and may also increase the risk of kidney stone formation.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, if QUDEXY XR is given concomitantly with another carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, the patient should be monitored for the appearance or worsening of metabolic acidosis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	QUDEXY XR, taken once daily, provides similar steady-state topiramate concentrations to immediate-release topiramate taken every 12 hours, when administered at the same total daily dose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a healthy volunteer, multiple-dose crossover study, the 90% CI for the ratios of AUC0-24, Cmax and Cmin, as well as partial AUC (the area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to time p (post dose)) for multiple time points were within the 80 to 125% bioequivalence limits, indicating no clinically significant difference between the two formulations.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In addition, the 90% CI for the ratios of topiramate plasma concentration at each of multiple time points over 24 hours for the two formulations were within the 80 to 125% bioequivalence limits, except for the initial time points before 3 hours and at 8 hours post-dose, which is not expected to have a significant clinical impact.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effects of switching between QUDEXY XR and immediate-release topiramate were also evaluated in the same multiple-dose, crossover, comparative bioavailability study.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In healthy subjects switched from immediate-release topiramate given every 12 hours to QUDEXY XR given once daily, similar concentrations were maintained immediately after the formulation switch.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	On the first day following the switch, there were no significant differences in AUC0-24, Cmax, and Cmin, as the 90% CI for the ratios were contained within the 80% to 125% equivalence limits.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	An apparent response of the female mouse to Cytotec in long-term studies at 100 to 1000 times the human dose was hyperostosis, mainly of the medulla of sternebrae.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hyperostosis did not occur in long-term studies in the dog and rat and has not been seen in humans treated with Cytotec.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There was no evidence of an effect of Cytotec on tumor occurrence or incidence in rats receiving daily doses up to 150 times the human dose for 24 months.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	The mutagenic potential of Cytotec was tested in several in vitro assays, all of which were negative.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Misoprostol, when administered to breeding male and female rats at doses 6.25 times to 625 times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose, produced dose-related pre- and post-implantation losses and a significant decrease in the number of live pups born at the highest dose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These findings suggest the possibility of a general adverse effect on fertility in males and females.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Congenital anomalies sometimes associated with fetal death have been reported subsequent to the unsuccessful use of misoprostol as an abortifacient, but the drug's teratogenic mechanism has not been demonstrated.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Several reports in the literature associate the use of misoprostol during the first trimester of pregnancy with skull defects, cranial nerve palsies, facial malformations, and limb defects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cytotec is not fetotoxic or teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses 625 and 63 times the human dose, respectively.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cytotec may endanger pregnancy (may cause abortion) and thereby cause harm to the fetus when administered to a pregnant woman.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cytotec may produce uterine contractions, uterine bleeding, and expulsion of the products of conception.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Vaginal administration of Cytotec, outside of its approved indication, has been used as a cervical ripening agent, for the induction of labor and for treatment of serious postpartum hemorrhage in the presence of uterine atony.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A major adverse effect of the obstetrical use of Cytotec is uterine tachysystole which may progress to uterine tetany with marked impairment of uteroplacental blood flow, uterine rupture (requiring surgical repair, hysterectomy, and/or salpingo-oophorectomy), or amniotic fluid embolism and lead to adverse fetal heart changes.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Uterine activity and fetal status should be monitored by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The risk of uterine rupture associated with misoprostol use in pregnancy increases with advancing gestational ages and prior uterine surgery, including Cesarean delivery.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Grand multiparity also appears to be a risk factor for uterine rupture.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	For hospital use only if misoprostol were to be used for cervical ripening, induction of labor, or for the treatment of serious post-partum hemorrhage, which are outside of the approved indication.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Misoprostol is extensively absorbed, and undergoes rapid de-esterification to its free acid, which is responsible for its clinical activity and, unlike the parent compound, is detectable in plasma.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The alpha side chain undergoes beta oxidation and the beta side chain undergoes omega oxidation followed by reduction of the ketone to give prostaglandin F analogs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In normal volunteers, Cytotec (misoprostol) is rapidly absorbed after oral administration with a Tmax of misoprostol acid of 12 <U+00B1> 3 minutes and a terminal half-life of 20<U+2013>40 minutes.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There is high variability of plasma levels of misoprostol acid between and within studies but mean values after single doses show a linear relationship with dose over the range of 200<U+2013>400 mcg.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	No accumulation of misoprostol acid was noted in multiple dose studies; plasma steady state was achieved within two days.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid, however, so this effect does not appear to be clinically important.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Pharmacokinetic studies in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment showed an approximate doubling of T1/2, Cmax, and AUC compared to normals, but no clear correlation between the degree of impairment and AUC.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In subjects over 64 years of age, the AUC for misoprostol acid is increased.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	No routine dosage adjustment is recommended in older patients or patients with renal impairment, but dosage may need to be reduced if the usual dose is not tolerated.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine and propranolol when these drugs were given with misoprostol.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The serum protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration-independent in the therapeutic range.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/ml (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/ml (CV 62%) after single 200 <U+00B5>g and 600 <U+00B5>g misoprostol administration, respectively.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to < 1 pg/ml at 5 hours post-dose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Misoprostol has both antisecretory (inhibiting gastric acid secretion) and (in animals) mucosal protective properties.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, and a deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by these agents.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but in man this has been shown at doses 200 mcg and above that are also antisecretory.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is therefore not possible to tell whether the ability of misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric ulcer is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In vitro studies on canine parietal cells using tritiated misoprostol acid as the ligand have led to the identification and characterization of specific prostaglandin receptors.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Receptor binding is saturable, reversible, and stereospecific.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The sites have a high affinity for misoprostol, for its acid metabolite, and for other E type prostaglandins, but not for F or I prostaglandins and other unrelated compounds, such as histamine or cimetidine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Receptor-site affinity for misoprostol correlates well with an indirect index of antisecretory activity.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is likely that these specific receptors allow misoprostol taken with food to be effective topically, despite the lower serum concentrations attained.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Misoprostol produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It has no significant effect on fasting or postprandial gastrin nor on intrinsic factor output.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Misoprostol, over the range of 50<U+2013>200 mcg, inhibits basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion, and acid secretion in response to a variety of stimuli, including meals, histamine, pentagastrin, and coffee.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Activity is apparent 30 minutes after oral administration and persists for at least 3 hours.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In general, the effects of 50 mcg were modest and shorter lived, and only the 200-mcg dose had substantial effects on nocturnal secretion or on histamine and meal-stimulated secretion.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cytotec has been shown to produce uterine contractions that may endanger pregnancy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cytotec does not produce clinically significant effects on serum levels of prolactin, gonadotropins, thyroid-stimulating hormone, growth hormone, thyroxine, cortisol, gastrointestinal hormones (somatostatin, gastrin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and motilin), creatinine, or uric acid.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Gastric emptying, immunologic competence, platelet aggregation, pulmonary function, or the cardiovascular system are not modified by recommended doses of Cytotec.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a series of small short-term (about 1 week) placebo-controlled studies in healthy human volunteers, doses of misoprostol were evaluated for their ability to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced mucosal injury.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Studies of 200 mcg q.i.d. of misoprostol with tolmetin and naproxen, and of 100 and 200 mcg q.i.d. with ibuprofen, all showed reduction of the rate of significant endoscopic injury from about 70<U+2013>75% on placebo to 10<U+2013>30% on misoprostol.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Doses of 25<U+2013>200 mcg q.i.d. reduced aspirin-induced mucosal injury and bleeding.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Two 12-week, randomized, double-blind trials in osteoarthritic patients who had gastrointestinal symptoms but no ulcer on endoscopy while taking an NSAID compared the ability of 200 mcg of Cytotec, 100 mcg of Cytotec, and placebo to reduce the risk of gastric ulcer (GU) formation.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients were approximately equally divided between ibuprofen, piroxicam, and naproxen, and continued this treatment throughout the 12 weeks.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The 200-mcg dose caused a marked, statistically significant reduction in gastric ulcers in both studies.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The lower dose was somewhat less effective, with a significant result in only one of the studies.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	No effect of Cytotec in reducing the risk of duodenal ulcers was demonstrated, but relatively few duodenal lesions were seen.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In another clinical trial, 239 patients receiving aspirin 650<U+2013>1300 mg q.i.d. for rheumatoid arthritis who had endoscopic evidence of duodenal and/or gastric inflammation were randomized to misoprostol 200 mcg q.i.d. or placebo for 8 weeks while continuing to receive aspirin.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The study evaluated the possible interference of Cytotec on the efficacy of aspirin in these patients with rheumatoid arthritis by analyzing joint tenderness, joint swelling, physician's clinical assessment, patient's assessment, change in ARA classification, change in handgrip strength, change in duration of morning stiffness, patient's assessment of pain at rest, movement, interference with daily activity, and ESR.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cytotec did not interfere with the efficacy of aspirin in these patients with rheumatoid arthritis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	ACCOLATE is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to zafirlukast or any of its inactive ingredients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The recommended dose of ACCOLATE in adults and children 12 years and older is 20 mg twice daily.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The recommended dose of ACCOLATE in children 5 through 11 years of age is 10 mg twice daily.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Elderly Patients: Based on cross-study comparisons, the clearance of zafirlukast is reduced in elderly patients (65 years of age and older), such that Cmax and AUC are approximately twice those of younger adults.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In clinical trials, a dose of 20 mg twice daily was not associated with an increase in the overall incidence of adverse events or withdrawals because of adverse events in elderly patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients with Hepatic Impairment: The clearance of zafirlukast is reduced in patients with stable alcoholic cirrhosis such that the Cmax and AUC are approximately 50 - 60% greater than those of normal adults.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	ACCOLATE has not been evaluated in patients with hepatitis or in long-term studies of patients with cirrhosis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients with Renal Impairment: Dosage adjustment is not required for patients with renal impairment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The mean prothrombin time (PT) increased by approximately 35%.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This interaction is probably due to an inhibition by zafirlukast of the cytochrome P450 2C9 isoenzyme system.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients on oral warfarin anticoagulant therapy and ACCOLATE should have their prothrombin times monitored closely and anticoagulant dose adjusted accordingly.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	No formal drug-drug interaction studies with ACCOLATE and other drugs known to be metabolized by the cytochrome P450 2C9 isoenzyme (eg, tolbutamide, phenytoin, carbamazepine) have been conducted; however, care should be exercised when ACCOLATE is coadministered with these drugs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Coadministration of zafirlukast (20 mg/day) or placebo at steady-state with a single dose of sustained release theophylline preparation (16 mg/kg) in 16 healthy boys and girls (6 through 11 years of age) resulted in no significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters of theophylline.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The mechanism of the interaction between ACCOLATE and theophylline in these patients is unknown.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a single-blind, parallel-group, 3-week study in 39 healthy female subjects taking oral contraceptives, 40 mg twice daily of zafirlukast had no significant effect on ethinyl estradiol plasma concentrations or contraceptive efficacy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	No formal drug-drug interaction studies between ACCOLATE and marketed drugs known to be metabolized by the P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) isoenzyme (eg, dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers, cyclosporin, cisapride) have been conducted.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	As ACCOLATE is known to be an inhibitor of CYP3A4 in vitro, it is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when these drugs are coadministered with ACCOLATE.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients should be told that a rare side effect of ACCOLATE is hepatic dysfunction, and to contact their physician immediately if they experience symptoms of hepatic dysfunction (eg. right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, jaundice, flu-like symptoms, and anorexia).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Liver failure resulting in liver transplantation and death has occurred in patients taking zafirlukast.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	ACCOLATE is indicated for the chronic treatment of asthma and should be taken regularly as prescribed, even during symptom-free periods.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	ACCOLATE is not a bronchodilator and should not be used to treat acute episodes of asthma.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients receiving ACCOLATE should be instructed not to decrease the dose or stop taking any other antiasthma medications unless instructed by a physician.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients should be instructed to notify their physician if neuropsychiatric events occur while using ACCOLATE.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Women who are breast-feeding should be instructed not to take ACCOLATE.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Alternative antiasthma medication should be considered in such patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients should be instructed to take ACCOLATE at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In rare cases, patients on ACCOLATE therapy may present with systemic eosinophilia, eosinophilic pneumonia, or clinical features of vasculitis consistent with Churg-Strauss syndrome, a condition which is often treated with systemic steroid therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These events usually, but not always, have been associated with the reduction of oral steroid therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Physicians should be alert to eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications, and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A causal association between ACCOLATE and these underlying conditions has not been established.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Neuropsychiatric events have been reported in adult, adolescent and pediatric patients taking ACCOLATE.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Post-marketing reports with ACCOLATE include insomnia and depression.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The clinical details of some post-marketing reports involving ACCOLATE appear consistent with a drug-induced effect.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients and prescribers should be alert for neuropsychiatric events.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients should be instructed to notify their prescriber if these changes occur.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	In two-year carcinogenicity studies, zafirlukast was administered at dietary doses of 10, 100, and 300 mg/kg to mice and 40, 400, and 2000 mg/kg to rats.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Male mice at an oral dose of 300 mg/kg/day (approximately 30 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults and in children on a mg/m2 basis) showed an increased incidence of hepatocellular adenomas; female mice at this dose showed a greater incidence of whole body histocytic sarcomas.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Male and female rats at an oral dose of 2000 mg/kg/day (resulting in approximately 160 times the exposure to drug plus metabolites from the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults and in children based on a comparison of the plasma area-under the curve [AUC] values) of zafirlukast showed an increased incidence of urinary bladder transitional cell papillomas.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Zafirlukast was not tumorigenic at oral doses up to 100 mg/kg (approximately 10 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults and in children on a mg/m2 basis) in mice and at oral doses up to 400 mg/kg (resulting in approximately 140 times the exposure to drug plus metabolites from the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults and in children based on a comparison of the plasma AUC values) in rats.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The clinical significance of these findings for the long-term use of ACCOLATE is unknown.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Zafirlukast showed no evidence of mutagenic potential in the reverse microbial assay, in 2 forward point mutation (CHO-HGPRT and mouse lymphoma) assays or in two assays for chromosomal aberrations (the in vitro human peripheral blood lymphocyte clastogenic assay and the in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus assay).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	No evidence of impairment of fertility and reproduction was seen in male and female rats treated with zafirlukast at oral doses up to 2000 mg/kg (approximately 410 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m2 basis).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	No teratogenicity was observed at oral doses up to 1600 mg/kg/day in mice (approximately 160 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m2 basis), up to 2000 mg/kg/day in rats (approximately 410 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m2 basis) and up to 2000 mg/kg/day in cynomolgus monkeys (which resulted in approximately 20 times the exposure to drug plus metabolites compared to that from the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults based on comparison of the AUC values).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	At an oral dose of 2000 mg/kg/day in rats, maternal toxicity and deaths were seen with increased incidence of early fetal resorption.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Spontaneous abortions occurred in cynomolgus monkeys at the maternally toxic oral dose of 2000 mg/kg/day.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There are no adequate and well-controlled trials in pregnant women.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because animal reproductive studies are not always predictive of human response, ACCOLATE should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Following repeated 40 mg twice-a-day dosing in healthy women, average steady-state concentrations of zafirlukast in breast milk were 50 ng/mL compared to 255 ng/mL in plasma.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for zafirlukast in mouse and rat studies and the enhanced sensitivity of neonatal rats and dogs to the adverse effects of zafirlukast, ACCOLATE should not be administered to mothers who are breast-feeding.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The safety of ACCOLATE at doses of 10 mg twice daily has been demonstrated in 205 pediatric patients 5 through 11 years of age in placebo-controlled trials lasting up to six weeks and with 179 patients in this age range participating in 52 weeks of treatment in an open label extension.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effectiveness of ACCOLATE for the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma in pediatric patients 5 through 11 years of age is based on an extrapolation of the demonstrated efficacy of ACCOLATE in adults with asthma and the likelihood that the disease course, and pathophysiology and the drug<U+2019>s effect are substantially similar between the two populations.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The recommended dose for the patients 5 through 11 years of age is based upon a cross-study comparison of the pharmacokinetics of zafirlukast in adults and pediatric subjects, and on the safety profile of zafirlukast in both adult and pediatric patients at doses equal to or higher than the recommended dose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The safety and effectiveness of zafirlukast for pediatric patients less than 5 years of age has not been established.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	A total of 8094 patients were exposed to zafirlukast in North American and European short-term placebo-controlled clinical trials.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Of these, 243 patients were elderly (age 65 years and older).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	No overall difference in adverse events was seen in the elderly patients, except for an increase in the frequency of infections among zafirlukast-treated elderly patients compared to placebo-treated elderly patients (7.0% vs. 2.9%).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The infections were not severe, occurred mostly in the lower respiratory tract, and did not necessitate withdrawal of therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An open-label, uncontrolled, 4-week trial of 3759 asthma patients compared the safety and efficacy of ACCOLATE 20 mg given twice daily in three patient age groups, adolescents (12-17 years), adults (18-65 years), and elderly (greater than 65 years).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A higher percentage of elderly patients (n=384) reported adverse events when compared to adults and adolescents.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These elderly patients showed less improvement in efficacy measures.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In the elderly patients, adverse events occurring in greater than 1% of the population included headache (4.7%), diarrhea and nausea (1.8%), and pharyngitis (1.3%).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The elderly reported the lowest percentage of infections of all three age groups in this study.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cases of life-threatening hepatic failure have been reported in patients treated with ACCOLATE.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cases of liver injury without other attributable cause have been reported from post-marketing adverse event surveillance of patients who have received the recommended dose of ACCOLATE (40 mg/day).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In most, but not all post-marketing reports, the patient<U+2019>s symptoms abated and the liver enzymes returned to normal or near normal after stopping ACCOLATE.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In rare cases, patients have either presented with fulminant hepatitis or progressed to hepatic failure, liver transplantation and death.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	The goal is to achieve growth hormone levels less than 5 ng/mL or IGF-I (somatomedin C) levels less than 1.9 unit/mL in males and less than 2.2 unit/mL in females.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The dose most commonly found to be effective is 100 mcg three times a day, but some patients require up to 500 mcg three times a day for maximum effectiveness.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Doses greater than 300 mcg/day seldom result in additional biochemical benefit, and if an increase in dose fails to provide additional benefit, the dose should be reduced.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	IGF-I (somatomedin C) or growth hormone levels should be reevaluated at 6-month intervals.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Sandostatin should be withdrawn yearly for approximately 4 weeks from patients who have received irradiation to assess disease activity.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If growth hormone or IGF-I (somatomedin C) levels increase and signs and symptoms recur, Sandostatin therapy may be resumed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The suggested daily dosage of Sandostatin during the first 2 weeks of therapy ranges from 100-600 mcg/day in 2-4 divided doses (mean daily dosage is 300 mcg).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In the clinical studies, the median daily maintenance dosage was approximately 450 mcg, but clinical and biochemical benefits were obtained in some patients with as little as 50 mcg, while others required doses up to 1500 mcg/day.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, experience with doses above 750 mcg/day is limited.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Daily dosages of 200-300 mcg in 2-4 divided doses are recommended during the initial 2 weeks of therapy (range: 150-750 mcg) to control symptoms of the disease.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	On an individual basis, dosage may be adjusted to achieve a therapeutic response, but usually doses above 450 mcg/day are not required.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Patients receiving insulin, oral hypoglycemic agents, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, or agents to control fluid and electrolyte balance, may require dose adjustments of these therapeutic agents.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Since it cannot be excluded that octreotide may have this effect, other drugs mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 and which have a low therapeutic index (e.g., quinidine, terfenadine) should therefore be used with caution.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Sandostatin<U+00AE> (octreotide acetate) alters the balance between the counter-regulatory hormones, insulin, glucagon and growth hormone, which may result in hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Sandostatin also suppresses secretion of thyroid stimulating hormone, which may result in hypothyroidism.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cardiac conduction abnormalities have also occurred during treatment with Sandostatin.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Female patients of childbearing potential should be advised to use adequate contraception during treatment with octreotide.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia which occurs during Sandostatin therapy is usually mild, but may result in overt diabetes mellitus or necessitate dose changes in insulin or other hypoglycemic agents.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia occurred on Sandostatin in 3% and 16% of acromegalic patients, respectively.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Severe hyperglycemia, subsequent pneumonia, and death following initiation of Sandostatin therapy was reported in one patient with no history of hyperglycemia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In patients with concomitant Type I diabetes mellitus, Sandostatin Injection and Sandostatin LAR<U+00AE> Depot (octreotide acetate for injectable suspension) are likely to affect glucose regulation, and insulin requirements may be reduced.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Symptomatic hypoglycemia, which may be severe, has been reported in these patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In non-diabetics and Type II diabetics with partially intact insulin reserves, Sandostatin Injection or Sandostatin LAR Depot administration may result in decreases in plasma insulin levels and hyperglycemia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is therefore recommended that glucose tolerance and antidiabetic treatment be periodically monitored during therapy with these drugs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In acromegalic patients, 12% developed biochemical hypothyroidism only, 8% developed goiter, and 4% required initiation of thyroid replacement therapy while receiving Sandostatin.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Careful instruction in sterile subcutaneous injection technique should be given to the patients and to other persons who may administer Sandostatin Injection.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Laboratory tests that may be helpful as biochemical markers in determining and following patient response depend on the specific tumor.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Based on diagnosis, measurement of the following substances may be useful in monitoring the progress of therapy: Acromegaly: Growth Hormone, IGF-I (somatomedin C) Responsiveness to Sandostatin may be evaluated by determining growth hormone levels at 1-4 hour intervals for 8-12 hours post dose.

Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The increased incidence of injection site tumors was most probably caused by irritation and the high sensitivity of the rat to repeated subcutaneous injections at the same site.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rotating injection sites would prevent chronic irritation in humans.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There have been no reports of injection site tumors in patients treated with Sandostatin for up to 5 years.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There was also a 15% incidence of uterine adenocarcinomas in the 1250 mcg/kg/day females compared to 7% in the saline-control females and 0% in the vehicle-control females.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The presence of endometritis coupled with the absence of corpora lutea, the reduction in mammary fibroadenomas, and the presence of uterine dilatation suggest that the uterine tumors were associated with estrogen dominance in the aged female rats which does not occur in humans.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Sandostatin did not impair fertility in rats at doses up to 1000 mcg/kg/day, which represents 7x the human exposure based on body surface area.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of octreotide use in pregnant women.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 16 times the highest recommended human dose based on body surface area and revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to octreotide.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In postmarketing data, a limited number of exposed pregnancies have been reported in patients with acromegaly.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Most women were exposed to octreotide during the first trimester of pregnancy at doses ranging from 100-300 mcg/day of Sandostatin s.c. or 20-30 mg/month of Sandostatin LAR, however some women elected to continue octreotide therapy throughout pregnancy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In cases with a known outcome, no congenital malformations were reported.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is not known whether octreotide is excreted into human milk.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when octreotide is administered to a nursing woman.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	No formal controlled clinical trials have been performed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Sandostatin in pediatric patients under age 6 years.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In post-marketing reports, serious adverse events, including hypoxia, necrotizing enterocolitis, and death, have been reported with Sandostatin use in children, most notably in children under 2 years of age.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The relationship of these events to octreotide has not been established as the majority of these pediatric patients had serious underlying co-morbid conditions.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The efficacy and safety of Sandostatin using the Sandostatin LAR Depot formulation was examined in a single randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, six month pharmacokinetics study in 60 pediatric patient's age 6-17 years with hypothalamic obesity resulting from cranial insult.

5	No unexpected adverse events were observed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, with Sandostatin LAR Depot 40 mg once a month, the incidence of new cholelithiasis in this pediatric population (33%) was higher than that seen in other adults indications such as acromegaly (22%) or malignant carcinoid syndrome (24%), where Sandostatin LAR Depot was 10 to 30 mg once a month.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Clinical studies of Sandostatin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Sandostatin<U+00AE> (octreotide acetate) exerts pharmacologic actions similar to the natural hormone, somatostatin.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is an even more potent inhibitor of growth hormone, glucagon, and insulin than somatostatin.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Like somatostatin, it also suppresses LH response to GnRH, decreases splanchnic blood flow, and inhibits release of serotonin, gastrin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, secretin, motilin, and pancreatic polypeptide.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	By virtue of these pharmacological actions, Sandostatin has been used to treat the symptoms associated with metastatic carcinoid tumors (flushing and diarrhea), and Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP) secreting adenomas (watery diarrhea).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Cases of epidural or spinal hemorrhage and subsequent hematomas have been reported with the use of Lovenox and epidural or spinal anesthesia/analgesia or spinal puncture procedures, resulting in long-term or permanent paralysis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The risk of these events is higher with the use of postoperative indwelling epidural catheters, with the concomitant use of additional drugs affecting hemostasis such as NSAIDs, with traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture, or in patients with a history of spinal surgery or spinal deformity.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	To reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of Lovenox and epidural or spinal anesthesia/analgesia or spinal puncture, consider the pharmacokinetic profile of Lovenox.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best performed when the anticoagulant effect of Lovenox is low; however, the exact timing to reach a sufficiently low anticoagulant effect in each patient is not known.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Placement or removal of a catheter should be delayed for at least 12 hours after administration of lower doses (30 mg once or twice daily or 40 mg once daily) of Lovenox, and at least 24 hours after the administration of higher doses (0.75 mg/kg twice daily, 1 mg/kg twice daily, or 1.5 mg/kg once daily) of Lovenox.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Anti-Xa levels are still detectable at these time points, and these delays are not a guarantee that neuraxial hematoma will be avoided.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients receiving the 0.75 mg/kg twice-daily dose or the 1 mg/kg twice-daily dose should not receive the second Lovenox dose in the twice-daily regimen to allow a longer delay before catheter placement or removal.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Likewise, although a specific recommendation for timing of a subsequent Lovenox dose after catheter removal cannot be made, consider delaying this next dose for at least four hours, based on a benefit-risk assessment considering both the risk for thrombosis and the risk for bleeding in the context of the procedure and patient risk factors.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For patients with creatinine clearance <30 mL/minute, additional considerations are necessary because elimination of Lovenox is more prolonged; consider doubling the timing of removal of a catheter, at least 24 hours for the lower prescribed dose of Lovenox (30 mg once daily) and at least 48 hours for the higher dose (1 mg/kg/day).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Should the physician decide to administer anticoagulation in the context of epidural or spinal anesthesia/analgesia or lumbar puncture, frequent monitoring must be exercised to detect any signs and symptoms of neurological impairment such as midline back pain, sensory and motor deficits (numbness or weakness in lower limbs), and bowel and/or bladder dysfunction.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Instruct patients to report immediately if they experience any of the above signs or symptoms.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If signs or symptoms of spinal hematoma are suspected, initiate urgent diagnosis and treatment including consideration for spinal cord decompression even though such treatment may not prevent or reverse neurological sequelae.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Use Lovenox with extreme caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage, such as bacterial endocarditis, congenital or acquired bleeding disorders, active ulcerative and angiodysplastic gastrointestinal disease, hemorrhagic stroke, or shortly after brain, spinal, or ophthalmological surgery, or in patients treated concomitantly with platelet inhibitors.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Major hemorrhages including retroperitoneal and intracranial bleeding have been reported.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Bleeding can occur at any site during therapy with Lovenox.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An unexplained fall in hematocrit or blood pressure should lead to a search for a bleeding site.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	To minimize the risk of bleeding following the vascular instrumentation during the treatment of unstable angina, non<U+2013>Q-wave myocardial infarction and acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, adhere precisely to the intervals recommended between Lovenox doses.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is important to achieve hemostasis at the puncture site after PCI.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In case a closure device is used, the sheath can be removed immediately.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If a manual compression method is used, sheath should be removed 6 hours after the last intravenous/subcutaneous Lovenox.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If the treatment with Lovenox is to be continued, the next scheduled dose should be given no sooner than 6 to 8 hours after sheath removal.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The site of the procedure should be observed for signs of bleeding or hematoma formation.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lovenox should be used with care in patients with a bleeding diathesis, uncontrolled arterial hypertension or a history of recent gastrointestinal ulceration, diabetic retinopathy, renal dysfunction and hemorrhage.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lovenox may cause heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITTS).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	HITTS may lead to organ infarction, limb ischemia, or death.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Use of Lovenox in patients with a history of immune-mediated HIT within the past 100 days or in the presence of circulating antibodies is contraindicated.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Circulating antibodies may persist for several years.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Only use Lovenox in patients with a history of HIT if more than 100 days have elapsed since the prior HIT episode and no circulating antibodies are present.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because HIT may still occur in these circumstances, the decision to use Lovenox in such a case must be made only after a careful benefit-risk assessment and after non-heparin alternative treatments are considered.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thrombocytopenia can occur with the administration of Lovenox.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Moderate thrombocytopenia (platelet counts between 100,000/mm3 and 50,000/mm3) occurred at a rate of 1.3% in patients given Lovenox, 1.2% in patients given heparin, and 0.7% in patients given placebo in clinical trials.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Platelet counts less than 50,000/mm3 occurred at a rate of 0.1% in patients given Lovenox, in 0.2% of patients given heparin, and 0.4% of patients given placebo in the same trials.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thrombocytopenia of any degree should be monitored closely.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm3, Lovenox should be discontinued.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lovenox cannot be used interchangeably (unit for unit) with heparin or other low molecular weight heparins as they differ in manufacturing process, molecular weight distribution, anti-Xa and anti-IIa activities, units, and dosage.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Each of these medicines has its own instructions for use.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Use of Lovenox for thromboprophylaxis in pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves may result in valve thrombosis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a clinical study of pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves given Lovenox (1 mg/kg twice daily) to reduce the risk of thromboembolism, 2 of 8 women developed clots resulting in blockage of the valve and leading to maternal and fetal death.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	No patients in the heparin/warfarin group (0 of 4 women) died.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There also have been isolated postmarketing reports of valve thrombosis in pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves while receiving Lovenox for thromboprophylaxis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves may be at higher risk for thromboembolism during pregnancy and, when pregnant, have a higher rate of fetal loss from stillbirth, spontaneous abortion, and premature delivery.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, frequent monitoring of peak and trough anti-Factor Xa levels, and adjusting of dosage may be needed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lovenox multiple-dose vials are not approved for use in neonates or infants.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Serious and fatal adverse reactions including gasping syndrome can occur in neonates and low birth weight infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including Lovenox multiple-dose vials.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The gasping syndrome is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which serious adverse reactions may occur is not known (Lovenox multiple-dose vials contain 15 mg of benzyl alcohol per mL).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because benzyl alcohol may cross the placenta, if anticoagulation with Lovenox is needed during pregnancy, use the preservative-free formulations where possible.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Enoxaparin is a low molecular weight heparin which has antithrombotic properties.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In humans, enoxaparin given at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg subcutaneously is characterized by a higher ratio of anti-Factor Xa to anti-Factor IIa activity (mean <U+00B1>SD, 14.0<U+00B1>3.1) (based on areas under anti-Factor activity versus time curves) compared to the ratios observed for heparin (mean <U+00B1>SD, 1.22<U+00B1>0.13).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Increases of up to 1.8 times the control values were seen in the thrombin time (TT) and the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Enoxaparin at a 1 mg/kg dose (100 mg/mL concentration), administered subcutaneously every 12 hours to patients in a large clinical trial resulted in aPTT values of 45 seconds or less in the majority of patients (n=1607).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A 30 mg intravenous bolus immediately followed by a 1 mg/kg subcutaneous administration resulted in aPTT postinjection values of 50 seconds.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Mean (n=46) peak anti-Factor Xa activity was 1.1 IU/mL at steady state in patients with unstable angina receiving 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours for 14 days.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Mean absolute bioavailability of enoxaparin, after 1.5 mg/kg given subcutaneously, based on anti-Factor Xa activity is approximately 100% in healthy subjects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A 30 mg intravenous bolus immediately followed by 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours provided initial peak anti-Factor Xa levels of 1.16 IU/mL (n=16) and average exposure corresponding to 84% of steady-state levels.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Steady state is achieved on the second day of treatment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Enoxaparin pharmacokinetics appears to be linear over the recommended dosage ranges.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	After repeated subcutaneous administration of 40 mg once daily and 1.5 mg/kg once-daily regimens in healthy volunteers, the steady state is reached on day 2 with an average exposure ratio about 15% higher than after a single dose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Steady-state enoxaparin activity levels are well predicted by single-dose pharmacokinetics.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	After repeated subcutaneous administration of the 1 mg/kg twice-daily regimen, the steady state is reached from day 4 with mean exposure about 65% higher than after a single dose and mean peak and trough levels of about 1.2 and 0.52 IU/mL, respectively.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Based on enoxaparin sodium pharmacokinetics, this difference in steady state is expected and within the therapeutic range.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Although not studied clinically, the 150 mg/mL concentration of enoxaparin sodium is projected to result in anticoagulant activities similar to those of 100 mg/mL and 200 mg/mL concentrations at the same enoxaparin dose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When a daily 1.5 mg/kg subcutaneous injection of enoxaparin sodium was given to 25 healthy male and female subjects using a 100 mg/mL or a 200 mg/mL concentration the following pharmacokinetic profiles were obtained.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Following subcutaneous dosing, the apparent clearance (CL/F) of enoxaparin is approximately 15 mL/min.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Metabolism Enoxaparin sodium is primarily metabolized in the liver by desulfation and/or depolymerization to lower molecular weight species with much reduced biological potency.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Renal clearance of active fragments represents about 10% of the administered dose and total renal excretion of active and non-active fragments 40% of the dose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Special Populations Gender Apparent clearance and Amax derived from anti-Factor Xa values following single subcutaneous dosing (40 mg and 60 mg) were slightly higher in males than in females.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The source of the gender difference in these parameters has not been conclusively identified; however, body weight may be a contributing factor.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Geriatric Apparent clearance and Amax derived from anti-Factor Xa values following single and multiple subcutaneous dosing in geriatric subjects were close to those observed in young subjects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Following once a day subcutaneous dosing of 40 mg enoxaparin, the Day 10 mean area under anti-Factor Xa activity versus time curve (AUC) was approximately 15% greater than the mean Day 1 AUC value.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Renal impairment A linear relationship between anti-Factor Xa plasma clearance and creatinine clearance at steady state has been observed, which indicates decreased clearance of enoxaparin sodium in patients with reduced renal function.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Anti-Factor Xa exposure represented by AUC, at steady state, is marginally increased in patients with creatinine clearance 50 to 80 mL/min and patients with creatinine clearance 30 to <50 mL/min renal impairment after repeated subcutaneous 40 mg once-daily doses.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	The usual recommended adult dose is 10 mg for a 70 kg individual administered subcutaneously, intramuscularly, or intravenously; this dose may be repeated every 3 to 6 hours as necessary.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dosage should be adjusted according to the severity of the pain, physical status of the patient, and other medications which the patient may be receiving.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In nontolerant individuals, the recommended single maximum dose is 20 mg with a maximum total daily dose of 160 mg.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The use of Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection as a supplement to balanced anesthesia requires larger doses than those recommended for analgesia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Induction doses of nalbuphine hydrochloride range from 0.3 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg intravenously to be administered over a 10 to 15 minute period with maintenance doses of 0.25 to 0.5 mg/kg in single intravenous administrations as required.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The use of Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection may be followed by respiratory depression which can be reversed with the opioid antagonist naloxone hydrochloride.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	If unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed, consider reducing the dosage.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse events.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When a patient who has been taking Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection regularly and may be physically dependent no longer requires therapy with Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection, taper the dose gradually, by 25% to 50% every 2 to 4 days, while monitoring carefully for signs and symptoms of withdrawal.

5	Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection is not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Opioid analgesics, including Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection, can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of use of Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection and when Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than 1 month of use.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The possible respiratory depressant effects and the potential of potent analgesics to elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure (resulting from vasodilation following CO2 retention) may be markedly exaggerated in the presence of head injury, intracranial lesions or a pre-existing increase in intracranial pressure.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Furthermore, potent analgesics can produce effects which may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injuries.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection should be used in these circumstances only when essential, and then should be administered with extreme caution.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection may impair the mental or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Assess each patient's risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Chronic use of opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection is a potent analgesic.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Its analgesic potency is essentially equivalent to that of morphine on a milligram basis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Receptor studies show that nalbuphine hydrochloride binds to mu, kappa, and delta receptors, but not to sigma receptors.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Nalbuphine hydrochloride is primarily a kappa agonist/partial mu antagonist analgesic.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The onset of action of nalbuphine hydrochloride occurs within 2 to 3 minutes after intravenous administration, and in less than 15 minutes following subcutaneous or intramuscular injection.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The plasma half-life of nalbuphine is 5 hours, and in clinical studies the duration of analgesic activity has been reported to range from 3 to 6 hours.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The opioid antagonist activity of nalbuphine hydrochloride is one-fourth as potent as nalorphine and 10 times that of pentazocine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Nalbuphine hydrochloride may produce the same degree of respiratory depression as equianalgesic doses of morphine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection exhibits a ceiling effect such that increases in dose greater than 30 mg do not produce further respiratory depression in the absence of other CNS active medications affecting respiration.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Nalbuphine hydrochloride by itself has potent opioid antagonist activity at doses equal to or lower than its analgesic dose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When administered following or concurrent with m<U+00B5> agonist opioid analgesics (e.g., morphine, oxymorphone, fentanyl), nalbuphine hydrochloride may partially reverse or block opioid-induced respiratory depression from the m<U+00B5> agonist analgesic.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection may precipitate withdrawal in patients dependent on opioid drugs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection should be used with caution in patients who have been receiving mu opioid analgesics on a regular basis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Table 4 includes clinically significant drug interactions with SUBLOCADE.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Clinically Significant Drug Interactions Benzodiazepines and Other Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants Clinical Impact: Due to additive pharmacologic effects, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, increases the risk of respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Intervention: Cessation of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants is preferred in most cases of concomitant use.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In some cases, monitoring in a higher level of care for taper may be appropriate.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In others, gradually tapering a patient off of a prescribed benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant or decreasing to the lowest effective dose may be appropriate.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Similarly, cessation of other CNS depressants is preferred when possible.Before co-prescribing benzodiazepines for anxiety or insomnia, ensure that patients are appropriately diagnosed and consider alternative medications and non-pharmacologic treatments.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Examples: Alcohol, non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, and other opioids.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Inhibitors of CYP3A4 Clinical Impact: The effects of co-administered CYP3A4 inhibitors on buprenorphine exposure in subjects treated with SUBLOCADE have not been studied and the effects may be dependent on the route of administration; however, such interactions have been established in studies using transmucosal buprenorphine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Buprenorphine is metabolized to norbuprenorphine primarily by CYP3A4; therefore, potential interactions may occur when SUBLOCADE is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity.The concomitant use of sublingual buprenorphine and CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) can increase the plasma concentration of buprenorphine, resulting in increased or prolonged opioid effects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Intervention: Patients who transfer to SUBLOCADE treatment from a regimen of transmucosal buprenorphine used concomitantly with CYP3A4 inhibitors [e.g., azole antifungals such as ketoconazole, macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin, and HIV protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, indinavir, and saquinavir)] should be monitored to ensure that the plasma buprenorphine level provided by SUBLOCADE is adequate.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Within 2 weeks of SUBLOCADE administration, if signs and symptoms of buprenorphine toxicity or overdose occur but the concomitant medication cannot be reduced or discontinued, it may be necessary to remove the depot and treat the patient with a formulation of buprenorphine that permits dose adjustments.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If the dose of SUBLOCADE is not adequate in the absence of the concomitant medication, that patient should be transitioned back to a formulation of buprenorphine that permits dose adjustments.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Examples: Macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir) CYP3A4 Inducers Clinical Impact: The effects of co-administered CYP3A4 inducers on buprenorphine exposure in subjects treated with SUBLOCADE have not been studied.Buprenorphine is metabolized to norbuprenorphine primarily by CYP3A4; therefore, potential interactions may occur when SUBLOCADE is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity.CYP3A4 inducers may induce the metabolism of buprenorphine and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in buprenorphine plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Intervention: Patients who transfer to SUBLOCADE treatment from a regimen of transmucosal buprenorphine used concomitantly with CYP3A4 inducers should be monitored to ensure that the plasma buprenorphine level provided by SUBLOCADE is adequate.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If the dose of SUBLOCADE is not adequate in the absence of the concomitant medication, and the concomitant medication cannot be reduced or discontinued, that patient should be transitioned back to a formulation of buprenorphine that permits dose adjustments.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Within 2 weeks of SUBLOCADE administration, if the dose provided by SUBLOCADE is excessive in the absence of the concomitant inducer, it may be necessary to remove the SUBLOCADE and treat the patient with a formulation of buprenorphine that permits dose adjustments.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Examples: Rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital Antiretrovirals: Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) Clinical Impact: Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) are metabolized principally by CYP3A4.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Efavirenz, nevirapine, and etravirine are known CYP3A inducers, whereas delavirdine is a CYP3A inhibitor.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Significant pharmacokinetic interactions between NNRTIs (e.g., efavirenz and delavirdine) and sublingual buprenorphine have been shown in clinical studies, but these pharmacokinetic interactions did not result in any significant pharmacodynamic effects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Intervention: Patients who are on chronic treatment with SUBLOCADE should be monitored for increase or decrease in therapeutic effects if NNRTIs are added to their treatment regimen.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Examples: Efavirenz, nevirapine, etravirine, delavirdine Antiretrovirals: Protease inhibitors (PIs) Clinical Impact: Studies have shown some antiretroviral protease inhibitors (PIs) with CYP3A4 inhibitory activity (nelfinavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, ritonavir) have little effect on sublingual buprenorphine pharmacokinetic and no significant pharmacodynamic effects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Other PIs with CYP3A4 inhibitory activity (atazanavir and atazanavir/ritonavir) resulted in elevated levels of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine after sublingual administration, and patients in one study reported increased sedation.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Symptoms of opioid excess have been found in postmarketing reports of patients receiving sublingual buprenorphine and atazanavir with and without ritonavir concomitantly.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It may be necessary to remove the depot and treat the patient with a sublingual buprenorphine product that permits rapid dose adjustments.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Examples: Atazanavir, ritonavir Antiretrovirals: Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) Clinical Impact: Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) do not appear to induce or inhibit the P450 enzyme pathway, thus no interactions with buprenorphine are expected.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Intervention: None Serotonergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Intervention: If concomitant use is warranted, carefully monitor the patient for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, particularly during treatment initiation, and during dose adjustment of the serotonergic drug.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Examples: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) Clinical Impact: MAOI interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Intervention: The use of SUBLOCADE is not recommended for patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Examples: Phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid Muscle Relaxants Clinical Impact: Buprenorphine may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Intervention: Monitor patients receiving muscle relaxants and SUBLOCADE for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected and decrease the dosage of the muscle relaxant as necessary.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Diuretics Clinical Impact: Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Intervention: Monitor patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Anticholinergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase the risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Intervention: Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when SUBLOCADE is used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CYP3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers: Monitor patients starting or ending CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers for potential over- or under-dosing.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Serotonergic Drugs: If concomitant use is warranted, monitor for serotonin syndrome, particularly during treatment initiation, and during dose adjustment of the serotonergic drug.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse: Buprenorphine can be abused in a manner similar to other opioids.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Monitor patients for conditions indicative of diversion or progression of opioid dependence and addictive behaviors.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Respiratory Depression: Life-threatening respiratory depression and death have occurred in association with buprenorphine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Warn patients of the potential danger of self-administration of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants while under treatment with SUBLOCADE.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome: Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) is an expected and treatable outcome of prolonged use of opioids during pregnancy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Adrenal Insufficiency: If diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement of corticosteroids, and wean patient off of the opioid.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Risk of Opioid Withdrawal With Abrupt Discontinuation: If treatment with SUBLOCADE is discontinued, monitor patients for several months for withdrawal and treat appropriately.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Risk of Hepatitis, Hepatic Events: Monitor liver function tests prior to and during treatment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Risk of Withdrawal in Patients Dependent on Full Agonist Opioids: Verify that patient is clinically stable on transmucosal buprenorphine before injecting SUBLOCADE.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Treatment of Emergent Acute Pain: Treat pain with a non-opioid analgesic whenever possible.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If opioid therapy is required, monitor patients closely because higher doses may be required for analgesic effect.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Intravenous injection presents significant risk of serious harm or death as SUBLOCADE forms a solid mass upon contact with body fluids.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Occlusion, local tissue damage, and thrombo-embolic events, including life threatening pulmonary emboli, could result if administered intravenously.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Do not administer intravenously or intramuscularly.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	SUBLOCADE is available only through a restricted program called the SUBLOCADE REMS Program because of the risk of serious harm or death that could result from intravenous self-administration.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The goal of the REMS is to mitigate serious harm or death that could result from intravenous self-administration by ensuring that healthcare settings and pharmacies are certified and only dispense SUBLOCADE directly to a healthcare provider for administration by a health care provider.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Notable requirements of the SUBLOCADE REMS Program include the following: Healthcare Settings and Pharmacies that order and dispense SUBLOCADE must be certified in the SUBLOCADE REMS Program.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Certified Healthcare Settings and Pharmacies must establish processes and procedures to verify SUBLOCADE is provided directly to a healthcare provider for administration by a healthcare provider, and the drug is not dispensed to the patient.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Certified Healthcare Settings and Pharmacies must not distribute, transfer, loan, or sell SUBLOCADE.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Further information is available at www.SublocadeREMS.com or call 1-866-258-3905.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	SUBLOCADE contains buprenorphine, a Schedule III controlled substance that can be abused in a manner similar to other opioids.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Buprenorphine is sought by people with opioid use disorder and is subject to criminal diversion.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Monitor all patients for progression of opioid use disorder and addictive behaviors.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Buprenorphine has been associated with life-threatening respiratory depression and death.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Many, but not all, postmarketing reports regarding coma and death involved misuse by self-injection or were associated with the concomitant use of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Use SUBLOCADE with caution in patients with compromised respiratory function (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cor pulmonale, decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Due to its extended-release characteristics, if SUBLOCADE is discontinued as a result of compromised respiratory function, monitor patients for ongoing buprenorphine effects for several months.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant use of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants increases the risk of adverse reactions including overdose, respiratory depression, and death.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Medication-assisted treatment of opioid use disorder, however, should not be categorically denied to patients taking these drugs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Prohibiting or creating barriers to treatment can pose an even greater risk of morbidity and mortality due to the opioid use disorder alone.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	As a routine part of orientation to buprenorphine treatment, educate patients about the risks of concomitant use of benzodiazepines, sedatives, opioid analgesics, and alcohol.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Develop strategies to manage use of prescribed or illicit benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants at initiation of buprenorphine treatment, or if it emerges as a concern during treatment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Adjustments to induction procedures and additional monitoring may be required.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There is no evidence to support dose limitations or arbitrary caps of buprenorphine as a strategy to address benzodiazepine use in buprenorphine-treated patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, if a patient is sedated at the time of buprenorphine dosing, delay or omit the buprenorphine dose if appropriate.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cessation of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants is preferred in most cases of concomitant use with buprenorphine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For patients in buprenorphine treatment, benzodiazepines are not the treatment of choice for anxiety or insomnia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Before co-prescribing benzodiazepines, ensure that patients are appropriately diagnosed and consider alternative medications and non-pharmacologic treatments to address anxiety or insomnia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Ensure that other healthcare providers prescribing benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants are aware of the patient's buprenorphine treatment and coordinate care to minimize the risks associated with concomitant use.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In addition, take measures to confirm that patients are taking their medications as prescribed and are not diverting or supplementing with illicit drugs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Toxicology screening should test for prescribed and illicit benzodiazepines.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) is an expected and treatable outcome of prolonged use of opioids during pregnancy, whether that use is medically-authorized or illicit.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, NOWS may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated in the neonate.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Healthcare professionals should observe newborns for signs of NOWS and manage accordingly.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Advise pregnant women receiving opioid addiction treatment with SUBLOCADE of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This risk should be balanced against the risk of untreated opioid addiction which often results in continued or relapsing illicit opioid use and is associated with poor pregnancy outcomes.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, prescribers should discuss the importance of management of opioid addiction throughout pregnancy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor and chronic administration produces physical dependence of the opioid type, characterized by withdrawal signs and symptoms upon abrupt discontinuation.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The withdrawal syndrome is milder than that seen with full agonists and may be delayed in onset.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Withdrawal signs and symptoms were not observed in the month following discontinuation of SUBLOCADE.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Considering the long half-life, any withdrawal signs and symptoms that may occur would be expected to be delayed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Model simulations indicate that steady-state buprenorphine plasma concentrations decreased slowly over time following the last injection and remained at therapeutic levels for 2 to 5 months on average, depending on the dosage administered (100 or 300 mg, respectively).

5	Cases of cytolytic hepatitis and hepatitis with jaundice have been observed in individuals receiving buprenorphine in clinical trials and through postmarketing adverse event reports.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The spectrum of abnormalities ranges from transient asymptomatic elevations in hepatic transaminases to case reports of death, hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, hepatorenal syndrome, and hepatic encephalopathy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In many cases, the presence of pre-existing liver enzyme abnormalities, infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus, concomitant usage of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs, and ongoing injecting drug use may have played a causative or contributory role.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In other cases, insufficient data were available to determine the etiology of the abnormality.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Withdrawal of buprenorphine has resulted in amelioration of acute hepatitis in some cases, however, in other cases no dose reduction was necessary.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The possibility exists that buprenorphine had a causative or contributory role in the development of the hepatic abnormality in some cases.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In one subject in the SUBLOCADE clinical program, surgical removal was followed by improvement in liver enzymes.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Liver function tests, prior to initiation of treatment, are recommended to establish a baseline.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	A history of hypersensitivity to buprenorphine is a contraindication to the use of SUBLOCADE.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because of the partial opioid agonist properties of buprenorphine, buprenorphine may precipitate opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms in persons who are currently physically dependent on full opioid agonists such as heroin, morphine, or methadone before the effects of the full opioid agonist have subsided.

5	While on SUBLOCADE, situations may arise where patients need acute pain management, or may require anesthesia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Treat patients receiving SUBLOCADE with a non-opioid analgesic whenever possible.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients requiring opioid therapy for analgesia may be treated with a high-affinity full opioid analgesic under the supervision of a physician, with particular attention to respiratory function.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Higher doses may be required for analgesic effect.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, a higher potential for toxicity exists with opioid administration.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If opioid therapy is required as part of anesthesia, patients should be continuously monitored in an anesthesia care setting by persons not involved in the conduct of the surgical or diagnostic procedure.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The opioid therapy should be provided by individuals specifically trained in the use of anesthetic drugs and the management of the respiratory effects of potent opioids, specifically the establishment and maintenance of a patent airway and assisted ventilation.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	In a pharmacokinetic study with transmucosal buprenorphine, buprenorphine plasma levels were found to be higher and the half-life was found to be longer in subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment, but not in subjects with mild hepatic impairment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of SUBLOCADE has not been studied.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because of the long-acting nature of the product, adjustments to dosages of SUBLOCADE are not rapidly reflected in plasma buprenorphine levels.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because buprenorphine levels cannot be rapidly decreased, patients with pre-existing moderate to severe hepatic impairment are not candidates for treatment with SUBLOCADE.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients who develop moderate to severe hepatic impairment while being treated with SUBLOCADE should be monitored for several months for signs and symptoms of toxicity or overdose caused by increased levels of buprenorphine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Buprenorphine has been observed to prolong the QTc interval in some patients participating in clinical trials.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These QTc findings were all sporadic and transient and none led to aberrant ventricular rhythm.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Review of ECG and adverse event data provided no evidence for syncope, seizure, or ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Physiological Effects Buprenorphine in IV (2, 4, 8, 12 and 16 mg) and sublingual (12 mg) doses have been administered to opioid-experienced subjects who were not physically dependent to examine cardiovascular, respiratory, and subjective effects at doses comparable to those used for treatment of opioid dependence.

5	In clinical studies conducted with SUBLOCADE at doses ranging from 50 to 300 mg, no incidences of temperature elevations, or clinically significant lowering of oxygen saturation were observed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Androgen Deficiency Chronic use of opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date.

Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Elimination Buprenorphine is metabolized and eliminated in urine and feces.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The apparent terminal plasma half-life of buprenorphine following subcutaneous injection of SUBLOCADE ranged between 43 to 60 days as a result of the slow release of buprenorphine from the subcutaneous depot.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	In urine, most of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine were conjugated (buprenorphine: 1% free and 9.4% conjugated; norbuprenorphine: 2.7% free and 11% conjugated).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In feces, almost all of the buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine were free (buprenorphine: 33% free and 5% conjugated; norbuprenorphine: 21% free and 2% conjugated).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drug Interaction Studies CYP3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers The effects of co-administered CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers on buprenorphine exposure in subjects treated with SUBLOCADE have not been studied; however, such interactions have been established in studies using transmucosal buprenorphine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effects of buprenorphine may be dependent on the route of administration.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Buprenorphine is metabolized to norbuprenorphine primarily by cytochrome CYP3A4; therefore, potential interactions may occur when SUBLOCADE is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effects of co-administered CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors have been established in studies using transmucosal buprenorphine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients who transfer to SUBLOCADE treatment from a regimen of transmucosal buprenorphine used concomitantly with CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole), macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), or HIV protease inhibitors, or CYP3A4 inducer (e.g., phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampicin) should be monitored to ensure that the plasma buprenorphine level provided by SUBLOCADE is adequate and not excessive.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Buprenorphine has been found to be a CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitor and its major metabolite, norbuprenorphine, has been found to be a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor in in vitro studies employing human liver microsomes.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, the plasma concentrations of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine resulting from therapeutic SUBLOCADE doses are not expected to significantly affect metabolism of other co-medications.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Specific Populations Based on population pharmacokinetic analyses, age, sex and race do not have a clinically meaningful effect on PK of SUBLOCADE.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of SUBLOCADE has not been studied.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, the effect of hepatic impairment on the PK of buprenorphine has been evaluated in a study using 2 mg/0.5 mg buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual tablet in subjects with various degrees of hepatic impairment as indicated by Child-Pugh criteria.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	The recommended dosage is 25 mg to 100 mg daily administered orally, in divided dosage, depending upon clinical response.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Pediatric Use Clinical studies establishing safety and effectiveness in children have not been done; therefore, usage is not recommended in children under 12 years of age.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies in rats have shown cleft palates at 25 to 50 times the human dose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Epidemiological studies in pregnant women, however, do not indicate that meclizine increases the risk of abnormalities when administered during pregnancy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Despite the animal findings, it would appear that the possibility of fetal harm is remote.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Nevertheless, meclizine, or any other medication, should be used during pregnancy only if clearly necessary.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	As meclizine undergoes metabolism, hepatic impairment may result in increased systemic exposure of the drug.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Treatment with meclizine should be administered with caution in patients with hepatic impairment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Due to a potential for drug/metabolite accumulation, meclizine should be administered with caution in patients with renal impairment and in the elderly as renal function generally declines with age.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drug Interactions There may be increased CNS depression when meclizine is administered concurrently with other CNS depressants, including alcohol, tranquilizers and sedatives.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Based on in vitro evaluation, meclizine is metabolized by CYP2D6.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore there is a possibility for a drug interaction between meclizine and CYP2D6 inhibitors.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Since drowsiness may, on occasion, occur with use of this drug, patients should be warned of this possibility and cautioned against driving a car or operating dangerous machinery.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients should avoid alcoholic beverages while taking this drug.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Due to its potential anticholinergic action, this drug should be used with caution in patients with asthma, glaucoma, or enlargement of the prostate gland.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Application may cause a transient feeling of warmth or slight stinging.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In cases where it has been necessary to temporarily discontinue therapy or reduce the frequency of application, therapy may be resumed or frequency of application increased when the patients become able to tolerate the treatment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Alterations of dose frequency should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Efficacy has not been established for less than once-daily dosing frequencies.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During the early weeks of therapy, an apparent increase in number and exacerbation of inflammatory acne lesions may occur.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This is due, in part, to the action of the medication on deep, previously unseen lesions and should not be considered a reason to discontinue therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therapeutic results should be noticed after two to three weeks, but more than six weeks of therapy may be required before definite beneficial effects are seen.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

Pseudoephedrine studies were conducted in rats at doses up to 150 times the human dose; triprolidine was studied in rats and rabbits at doses up to 125 times the human dose, and codeine studies were conducted in rats and rabbits at doses up to 150 times the human dose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	No evidence of teratogenic harm to the fetus was revealed in any of these studies.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, overt signs of toxicity were observed in the dams which received pseudoephedrine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This was reflected in reduced average weight and length and rate of skeletal ossification in their fetuses.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Nursing Mothers: The components of Triacin-C are excreted in breast milk in small amounts, but the significance of their effects on nursing infants is not known.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from maternal ingestion of this product, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Pediatric Use: Respiratory depression and death have occurred in children with obstructive sleep apnea who received codeine in the post-operative period following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy and had evidence of being ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine (i.e., multiple copies of the gene for cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2D6 or high morphine concentrations).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These children may be particularly sensitive to the respiratory depressant effects of codeine that has been rapidly metabolized to morphine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Codeine is contraindicated for post-operative pain management in these patients As in adults, the combination of an antihistamine, sympathomimetic amine and codeine can elicit either mild stimulation or mild sedation in pediatric patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Deaths have also occurred in nursing infants who were exposed to high levels of morphine in breast milk because their mothers were ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Some individuals may be ultra-rapid metabolizers because of a specific CYP2D6 genotype (gene duplications denoted as *1/*1xN or *1/*2xN).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The prevalence of this CYP2D6 phenotype varies widely and has been estimated at 0.5 to 1% in Chinese and Japanese, 0.5 to 1% in Hispanics, 1 to 10% in Caucasians, 3% in African Americans, and 16 to 28% in North Africans, Ethiopians, and Arabs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Data are not available for other ethnic groups.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These individuals convert codeine into its active metabolite, morphine, more rapidly and completely than other people.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This rapid conversion results in higher than expected serum morphine levels.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Even at labeled dosage regimens, individuals who are ultra-rapid metabolizers may have life-threatening or fatal respiratory depression or experience signs of overdose (such as extreme sleepiness, confusion, or shallow breathing).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Children with obstructive sleep apnea who are treated with codeine for post-tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy pain may be particularly sensitive to the respiratory depressant effects of codeine that has been rapidly metabolized to morphine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Codeine is contraindicated for post-operative pain management in all pediatric patients undergoing tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When prescribing codeine-containing drugs, healthcare providers should choose the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time and inform patients and caregivers about these risks and the signs of morphine overdose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Triacin-C should be used with considerable caution in patients with increased intraocular pressure (narrow angle glaucoma), stenosing peptic ulcer, pyloroduodenal obstruction, symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy, bladder neck obstruction, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, and hyperthyroidism.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In the presence of head injury or other intracranial lesions, the respiratory depressant effects of codeine and other narcotics may be markedly enhanced, as well as their capacity for elevating cerebrospinal fluid pressure.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Narcotics also produce other CNS depressant effects, such as drowsiness, that may further obscure the clinical course of patients with head injuries.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Codeine or other narcotics may obscure signs on which to judge the diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Codeine: Codeine probably exerts its antitussive activity by depressing the medullary (brain) cough center, thereby raising its threshold for incoming cough impulses.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Codeine is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, with a therapeutic dose reaching peak antitussive effectiveness in about 2 hours and persisting for 4 to 6 hours.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Codeine is rapidly distributed from blood to body tissues and taken up preferentially by parenchymatous organs such as liver, spleen and kidney.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It passes the blood brain barrier and is found in fetal tissue and breast milk.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The drug is not bound by plasma proteins nor is it accumulated in body tissues.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Codeine is metabolized in the liver to morphine and norcodeine, each representing about 10 percent of the administered codeine dose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	About 90 percent of the dose is excreted within 24 hours, primarily through the kidneys.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Urinary excretion products are free and glucuronide-conjugated codeine (about 70%), free and conjugated norcodeine (about 10%), free and conjugated morphine (about 10%), normorphine (under 4%) and hydrocodone (<1%).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The remainder of the dose appears in the feces.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Triprolidine: Antihistamines such as triprolidine hydrochloride act as antagonists of the H1 histamine receptor.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Consequently, they prevent histamine from eliciting typical immediate hypersensitivity responses in the nose, eyes, lungs and skin.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Animal distribution studies have shown localization of triprolidine in lung, spleen and kidney tissue.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Liver microsome studies have revealed the presence of several metabolites with an oxidized product of the toluene methyl group predominating.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Pseudoephedrine: Pseudoephedrine acts as an indirect sympathomimetic agent by stimulating sympathetic (adrenergic) nerve endings to release norepinephrine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Norepinephrine in turn stimulates alpha and beta receptors throughout the body.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The action of pseudoephedrine hydrochloride is apparently more specific for the blood vessels of the upper respiratory tract and less specific for the blood vessels of the systemic circulation.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The vasoconstriction elicited at these sites results in the shrinkage of swollen tissues in the sinuses and nasal passages.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Pseudoephedrine is rapidly and almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Considerable variation in half-life has been observed (from about 4<U+00BD> to 10 hours), which is attributed to individual differences in absorption and excretion.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Excretion rates are also altered by urine pH, increasing with acidification and decreasing with alkalinization.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	As a result, mean half-life falls to about 4 hours at pH 5 and increases to 12 to 13 hours at pH 8.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	After administration of a 60 mg tablet, 87 to 96% of the pseudoephedrine is cleared from the body within 24 hours.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The drug is distributed to body tissues and fluids, including fetal tissue, breast milk and the central nervous system (CNS).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	About 55 to 75% of an administered dose is excreted unchanged in the urine; the remainder is apparently metabolized in the liver to inactive compounds by N-demethylation, parahydroxylation and oxidative deamination.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hypersensitivity to any component of this medication.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients with severe renal disease will accumulate aminosalicylic acid and its acetyl metabolite but will continue to acetylate, thus leading exclusively to the inactive acetylated form; deacetylation, if any, is not significant.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The half life of free aminosalicylic acid in renal disease is 30.8 minutes in comparison to 26.4 minutes in normal volunteers. but the half life of the inactive metabolite is 309 minutes in uremic patients in comparison to 51 minutes in normal volunteers.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Although aminosalicylic acid passes dialysis membranes, the frequency of dialysis usually is not comparable to the half-life of 50 minutes for the free acid.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients with end stage renal disease should not receive aminosalicylic acid.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	PASER granules should be administered with other drugs to which the organism is known or expected to be susceptible.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is most commonly administered to patients with Multi-drug Resistant TB (MDR-TB) or in other situations in which therapy with isoniazid or rifampin is not possible due to a combination of resistance and/or intolerance.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The adult dosage of four grams (one packet) three times per day or correspondingly smaller doses in children should be given by sprinkling on apple sauce or yogurt or by swirling in the glass to suspend the granules in an acidic drink such as tomato or orange juice.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	DO NOT USE if packet is swollen or the granules have lost their tan color, turning dark brown or purple.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effect is dose related and, while it has not been studied with the current delayed release preparation, the lower serum levels with this preparation will result in a reduced effect on the acetylation of INH.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A subsequent report has shown that this blockade was due to an excipient not included in PASER granules.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Oral administration of a solution containing both aminosalicylic acid and rifampin showed full absorption of each product.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	As a result of competition, Vitamin B12 absorption has been reduced 55% by 5 grams of aminosalicylic acid with clinically significant erythrocyte abnormalities developing after depletion; patients on therapy of more than one month should be considered for maintenance B12.

5	A malabsorption syndrome can develop in patients on aminosalicylic acid but is usually not complete.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Triglyceride absorption always is normal.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	All drugs should be stopped at the first sign suggesting a hypersensitivity reaction.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Desensitization has been accomplished successfully in 15 of 17 patients starting with 10 mg aminosalicylic acid given as a single dose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The dosage is doubled every 2 days until reaching a total of 1 gram after which the dosage is divided to follow the regular schedule of administration.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If a mild temperature rise or skin reaction develops, the increment is to be dropped back one level or the progression held for one cycle.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Reactions are rare after a total dosage of 1.5 grams.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients with hepatic disease may not tolerate aminosalicylic acid as well as normal patients, even though the metabolism in patients with hepatic disease has been reported to be comparable to that in normal volunteers.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The patient should be advised that the first signs of hypersensitivity include a rash, often followed by fever, and much less frequently, GI disturbances of anorexia, nausea or diarrhea.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If such symptoms develop, the patient should immediately cease taking the medication and arrange for a prompt clinical visit.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients should be advised that poor compliance in taking anti-TB medication often leads to treatment failure, and, not infrequently, to the development of resistance of the organisms in the individual patient.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients should be advised that the skeleton of the granules may be seen in the stool.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The coating to protect the PASER granules dissolves promptly under neutral conditions; the granules therefore should be administered by sprinkling on acidic foods such as apple sauce or yogurt or by suspension in a fruit drink which will protect the coating, but the granules sink and will have to be swirled.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The coating will last at least 2 hours in either system.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	When administered to rabbits at 5 mg/kg, throughout all three trimesters, no teratologic or embryocidal effects were seen.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Literature reports on aminosalicylic acid in pregnant women always report coadministration of other medications.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because there are no adequate and well controlled studies of aminosalicylic acid in humans, PASER granules should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	After administration of a different preparation of aminosalicylic acid to one patient, the maximum concentration in the milk was 1 <U+03BC>g/mL at 3 hours with a half-life of 2.5 hours; the maximum maternal plasma concentration was 70 <U+03BC>g/mL at two hours.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Liver Function In one retrospective study of 7492 patients on rapidly absorbed aminosalicylic acid preparations, drug-induced hepatitis occurred in 38 patients (0.5%); in these 38 the first symptom usually appeared within three months of the start of therapy with a rash as the most common event followed by fever and much less frequently by GI disturbances of anorexia, nausea or diarrhea.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Only one patient was diagnosed on routine biochemistry.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Premonitory symptoms in 90% of these 38 patients preceded jaundice by a few days to several weeks with the mean time of onset 33 days with a range of 7-90 days.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Half of the adverse reactions occurred during the third, fourth or fifth weeks.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When aminosalicylic acid-induced hepatitis was diagnosed, hepatomegaly was invariably present with lymphadenopathy in 46%, leucocytosis in 79%, and eosinophilia in 55%.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Prompt recognition with discontinuation led to the recovery of all 38 patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If recognized in the premonitory stage, the reaction is reported to <U+201C>settle<U+201D> in 24 hours and no jaundice ensues.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	From other reported studies failure to recognize the reaction can result in a mortality of up to 21%.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The patient must be monitored carefully during the first three months of therapy and treatment must be discontinued immediately at the first sign of a rash, fever or other premonitory signs of intolerance.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Mechanism of Action: Aminosalicylic acid is bacteriostatic against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It inhibits the onset of bacterial resistance to streptomycin and isoniazid.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The mechanism of action has been postulated to be inhibition of folic acid synthesis (but without potentiation with antifolic compounds) and/or inhibition of synthesis of the cell wall component, mycobactin, thus reducing iron uptake by M. tuberculosis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Characteristics: The two major considerations in the clinical pharmacology of aminosalicylic acid are the prompt production of a toxic inactive metabolite under acid conditions and the short serum half life of one hour for the free drug.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	After two hours in simulated gastric fluid, 10% of unprotected aminosalicylic acid is decarboxylated to form meta-aminophenol, a known hepatotoxin.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The acid-resistant coating of the PASER granules protects against degradation in the stomach.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The small granules are designed to escape the usual restriction on gastric emptying of large particles.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Under neutral conditions such as are found in the small intestine or in neutral foods, the acid-resistant coating is dissolved within one minute.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Care must be taken in the administration of these granules to protect the acid-resistant coating by maintaining the granules in an acidic food during dosage administration.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients who have neutralized gastric acid with antacids will not need to protect the acid resistant coating with an acidic food since no acid is present to spoil the drug.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Antacids may influence the absorption of other medications and are not necessary for PASER consumed with an acidic food.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because PASER granules are protected by an enteric coating absorption does not commence until they leave the stomach; the soft skeletons of the granules remain and may be seen in the stool.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Absorption and excretion: In a single 4 gram pharmacokinetic study with food in normal volunteers the initial time to a 2<U+03BC>g/mL serum level of aminosalicylic acid was 2 hours with a range of 45 minutes to 24 hours; the median time to peak was 6 hours with a range of 1.5 to 24 hours; the mean peak level was 20 <U+03BC>g/mL with a range of 9 to 35 <U+03BC>g/mL; a level of 2 <U+03BC>g/mL was maintained for an average of 7.9 hours with a range of 5 to 9; a level of 1 <U+03BC>g/mL was maintained for an average of 8.8 hours with a range of 6 to 11.5 hours.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The recommended schedule is 4 grams every 8 hours.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	80% of aminosalicylic acid is excreted in the urine, with 50% or more of the dosage excreted in acetylated form.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The acetylation process is not genetically determined as is the case for isoniazid.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Aminosalicylic acid is excreted by glomerular filtration; although previously reported otherwise, probenecid, a tubular blocking agent, does not enhance plasma concentration.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a 1954 study thyroxine synthesis but not iodide uptake was reported reduced about 40% when the sodium salt (not PASER granules) of aminosalicylic acid was administered one hour before radio-iodine; the sodium salt typically produces a serum level over 120 <U+03BC>g/mL at one hour lasting one hour.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Occasional goiter development can be prevented by the administration of thyroxine but not iodide.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid occurs only if the meminges are inflamed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Approximately 50-60% of aminosalicylic acid is protein bound; binding is reported to be reduced 50% in kwashiorkor.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Microbiology: The aminosalicylic acid MIC for M. tuberculosis in 7H11 agar was less than 1.0 <U+03BC>g/mL for nine strains including three multidrug resistant strains, but 4 and 8 <U+03BC>g/mL for two other multidrug resistant strains.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The 90% inhibition in 7H12 broth (Bactec) showed little dose response but was interpreted as being less than or equal to 0.12-0.25 <U+03BC>g/mL for eight strains of which three were multi-resistant, 0.50 <U+03BC>g/mL for one resistant strain, questionable for four non-resistant strains and greater than 1<U+03BC>g/mL for one non-resistant and three resistant strains.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Aminosalicylic acid is not active in vitro against M. avium.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Severe and sometimes fatal hepatitis associated with isoniazid therapy has been reported and may occur or may develop even after many months of treatment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The risk of developing hepatitis is age related.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Approximate case rates by age are: less than 1 per 1,000 for persons under 20 years of age, 3 per 1,000 for persons in the 20 to 34 year age group, 12 per 1,000 for persons in the 35 to 49 year age group, 23 per 1,000 for persons in the 50 to 64 year age group, and 8 per 1,000 for persons over 65 years of age.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The risk of hepatitis is increased with daily consumption of alcohol.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Precise data to provide a fatality rate for isoniazid-related hepatitis is not available; however, in a U.S. Public Health Service Surveillance Study of 13,838 persons taking isoniazid, there were 8 deaths among 174 cases of hepatitis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, patients given isoniazid should be carefully monitored and interviewed at monthly intervals.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For persons 35 and older, in addition to monthly symptom reviews, hepatic enzymes (specifically, AST and ALT (formerly SGOT and SGPT, respectively)) should be measured prior to starting isoniazid therapy and periodically throughout treatment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Isoniazid-associated hepatitis usually occurs during the first three months of treatment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Usually, enzyme levels return to normal despite continuance of drug, but in some cases progressive liver dysfunction occurs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Other factors associated with an increased risk of hepatitis include daily use of alcohol, chronic liver disease and injection drug use.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A recent report suggests an increased risk of fatal hepatitis associated with isoniazid among women, particularly black and Hispanic women.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The risk may also be increased during the post partum period.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	More careful monitoring should be considered in these groups, possibly including more frequent laboratory monitoring.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If abnormalities of liver function exceed three to five times the upper limit of normal, discontinuation of isoniazid should be strongly considered.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Liver function tests are not a substitute for a clinical evaluation at monthly intervals or for the prompt assessment of signs or symptoms of adverse reactions occurring between regularly scheduled evaluations.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients should be instructed to immediately report signs or symptoms consistent with liver damage or other adverse effects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These include any of the following: unexplained anorexia, nausea, vomiting, dark urine, icterus, rash, persistent paresthesias of the hands and feet, persistent fatigue, weakness or fever of greater than 3 days duration and/or abdominal tenderness, especially right upper quadrant discomfort.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If these symptoms appear or if signs suggestive of hepatic damage are detected, isoniazid should be discontinued promptly, since continued use of the drug in these cases has been reported to cause a more severe form of liver damage.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients with tuberculosis who have hepatitis attributed to isoniazid should be given appropriate treatment with alternative drugs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If isoniazid must be reinstituted, it should be reinstituted only after symptoms and laboratory abnormalities have cleared.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The drug should be restarted in very small and gradually increasing doses and should be withdrawn immediately if there is any indication of recurrent liver involvement.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Preventive treatment should be deferred in persons with acute hepatic diseases.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Isoniazid is contraindicated in patients who develop severe hypersensitivity reactions, including drug-induced hepatitis; previous isoniazid-associated hepatic injury; severe adverse reactions to isoniazid such as drug fever, chills, arthritis; and acute liver disease of any etiology.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Non-Pharmacokinetic interactionTE: For preventive therapy of tuberculous infection and treatment of tuberculosis, it is recommended that physicians be familiar with the following publications: (1) the recommendations of the Advisory Council for the Elimination of Tuberculosis, published in the MMWR: vol 42; RR-4, 1993 and (2) Treatment of Tuberculosis and Tuberculosis Infection in Adults and Children, American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine: vol 149; 1359-1374, 1994.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Isoniazid Injection USP is used in conjunction with other effective antituberculous agents.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drug susceptibility testing should be performed on the organism initially isolated from all patients with newly diagnosed tuberculosis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If the bacilli becomes resistant, therapy must be changed to agents to which the bacilli are susceptible.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	5 mg/kg up to 300 mg daily in a single dose; or 15 mg/kg up to 900 mg/day, two or three times/week 10 to 15 mg/kg up to 300 mg daily in a single dose; or 20 to 40 mg/kg up to 900 mg/day, two or three times/week There are three regimen options for the initial treatment of tuberculosis in children and adults: Option 1: Daily isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide for 8 weeks followed by 16 weeks of isoniazid and rifampin daily or 2 to 3 times weekly.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Ethambutol or streptomycin should be added to the initial regimen until sensitivity to isoniazid and rifampin is demonstrated.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The addition of a fourth drug is optional if the relative prevalence of isoniazid-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates in the community is less than or equal to four percent.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Option 2: Daily isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide and streptomycin or ethambutol for 2 weeks followed by twice weekly administration of the same drugs for 6 weeks, subsequently twice weekly isoniazid and rifampin for 16 weeks.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Option 3: Three times weekly with isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol or streptomycin for 6 months.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	*All regimens given twice weekly or 3 times weekly should be administered by directly observed therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The above treatment guidelines apply only when the disease is caused by organisms that are susceptible to the standard antituberculous agents.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because of the impact of resistance to isoniazid and rifampin on the response to therapy, it is essential that physicians initiating therapy for tuberculosis be familiar with the prevalence of drug resistance in their communities.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is suggested that ethambutol not be used in children whose vital acuity cannot be monitored.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The response of the immunologically impaired host to treatment may not be satisfactory as that of a person with normal host responsiveness.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For this reason, therapeutic decisions for the impaired host must be individualized.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Since patients co-infected with HIV may have problems with malabsorption, screening of antimycobacterial drug levels, especially in patients with advanced HIV disease, may be necessary to prevent the emergence of MDRTB.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The basic principles that underlie the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis also apply to Extra pulmonary forms of the disease.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Although there have not been the same kinds of carefully conducted controlled trials of treatment of Extra pulmonary tuberculosis as for pulmonary disease, increasing clinical experience indicates that a 6 to 9 month short-course regimens are effective.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because of the insufficient data, miliary tuberculosis, bone/joint tuberculosis, and tuberculosis meningitis in infants and children should receive 12 month therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Bacteriologic evaluation of Extra pulmonary tuberculosis may be limited by the relative inaccessibility of the sites of disease.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thus, response to treatment often must be judged on the basis of clinical and radiographic findings.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The use of adjunctive therapies such as surgery and corticosteroids is more commonly required in Extra pulmonary tuberculosis than in pulmonary disease.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Surgery may be necessary to obtain specimens for diagnosis and to treat such processes as constrictive pericarditis and spinal cord compression from Potts Disease.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Corticosteroids have been shown to be of benefit in preventing cardiac constriction from tuberculous pericarditis and in decreasing the neurologic sequelae of all stages of tuberculosis meningitis, especially when administered early in the course of the disease.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The options listed above must be adjusted for the pregnant patient.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Streptomycin interferes with in utero development of the ear and may cause congenital deafness.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Routine use of pyrazinamide is also not recommended in pregnancy because of inadequate teratogenicity data.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The initial treatment regimen should consist of isoniazid and rifampin.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Ethambutol should be included unless primary isoniazid resistance is unlikely (isoniazid resistance rate documented to be less than 4%).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Multiple-drug resistant tuberculosis (i.e., resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampin) presents difficult treatment problems.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Treatment must be individualized and based on susceptibility studies.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In such cases, consultation with an expert in tuberculosis is recommended.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A major cause of drug-resistant tuberculosis is patient non-compliance with treatment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The use of DOT can help assure patient compliance with drug therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	DOT is the observation of the patient by a health care provider or other responsible person as the patient ingests antituberculosis medications.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	DOT can be achieved with daily, twice weekly or thrice weekly regimens, and is recommended for all patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Before isoniazid preventive therapy is initiated, bacteriologically positive or radiographically progressive tuberculosis must be excluded.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Appropriate evaluations should be performed if Extra pulmonary tuberculosis is suspected.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Adults over 30 Kg: 300 mg per day in a single dose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Infants and Children: 10 mg/kg (up to 300 mg daily) in a single dose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In situations where adherence with daily preventative therapy cannot be assured, 20 to 30 mg/kg (not to exceed 900 mg) twice weekly under the direct observation of a health care worker at the time of administration8.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Continuous administration of isoniazid for a sufficient period of time is an essential part of the regimen because relapse rates are higher if chemotherapy is stopped prematurely.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In the treatment of tuberculosis, resistant organisms may multiply and the emergence during the treatment may necessitate a change in the regimen.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For following patient compliance: the Potts-Cozart test9, a simple colorimetric6 method of checking for isoniazid in the urine, is a useful tool for assuring patient compliance, which is essential for effective tuberculosis control.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Additionally, isoniazid test strips are also available to check patient compliance.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant administration of pyridoxine (B6) is recommended in the malnourished and in those predisposed to neuropathy (e.g., alcoholics and diabetics).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Isoniazid should not be administered with food.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Tyramine- and histamine-containing foods should be avoided in patients receiving isoniazid.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because isoniazid has some monoamine oxidase inhibiting activity, an interaction with tyramine-containing foods (cheese, red wine) may occur.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Diamine oxidase may also be inhibited, causing exaggerated response (e.g., headache, sweating, palpitations, flushing, hypotension) to foods containing histamine (e.g., skipjack, tuna, other tropical fish).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A report of severe acetaminophen toxicity was reported in a patient receiving Isoniazid.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is believed that the toxicity may have resulted from a previously unrecognized interaction between isoniazid and acetaminophen and a molecular basis for this interaction has been proposed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, current evidence suggests that isoniazid does induce P-450IIE1, a mixed-function oxidase enzyme that appears to generate the toxic metabolites, in the liver.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Furthermore it has been proposed that isoniazid resulted in induction of P-450IIE1 in the patients liver which, in turn, resulted in a greater proportion of the ingested acetaminophen being converted to the toxic metabolites.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Studies have demonstrated that pretreatment with isoniazid potentiates acetaminophen hepatotoxicity in rats1,2.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Carbamazepine levels should be determined prior to concurrent administration with isoniazid, signs and symptoms of carbamazepine toxicity should be monitored closely, and appropriate dosage adjustment of the anticonvulsant should be made3.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Potential interaction of Ketoconazole and Isoniazid may exist.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Since the therapeutic range of theophylline is narrow, theophylline serum levels should be monitored closely, and appropriate dosage adjustments of theophylline should be made7.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Plasma valproate concentration should be monitored when isoniazid and valproate are co-administered, and appropriate dosage adjustments of valproate should be made5.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	All drugs should be stopped and an evaluation made at the first sign of a hypersensitivity reaction.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If isoniazid therapy must be reinstituted, the drug should be given only after symptoms have cleared.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The drug should be restarted in very small and gradually increasing doses and should be withdrawn immediately if there is any indication of recurrent hypersensitivity reaction.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Use of isoniazid should be carefully monitored in the following: 1.Daily users of alcohol.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Daily ingestion of alcohol may be associated with a higher incidence of + isoniazid hepatitis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	2.Patients with active chronic liver disease or severe renal dysfunction.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	4.Concurrent use of any chronically administered medication.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	5.History of previous discontinuation of isoniazid.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	6.Existence of peripheral neuropathy or conditions predisposing to neuropathy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	9.Women belonging to minority groups, particularly in the post-partum period.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Periodic ophthalmologic examinations during isoniazid therapy are recommended when visual symptoms occur.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because there is a higher frequency of isoniazid associated hepatitis among certain patient groups, including Age >35, daily users of alcohol, chronic liver disease, injection drug use and women belonging to minority groups, particularly in the post-partum period, transaminase measurements should be obtained prior to starting and monthly during preventative therapy, or more frequently as needed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If any of the values exceed three to five times the upper limit of normal, isoniazid should be temporarily discontinued and consideration given to restarting therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Isoniazid has been shown to induce pulmonary tumors in a number of strains of mice.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Isoniazid has not been shown to be carcinogenic in humans.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	(Note: a diagnosis of mesothelioma in a child with prenatal exposure to isoniazid and no other apparent risk factors has been reported).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Isoniazid has been found to be weakly mutagenic in strains TA 100 and TA 1535 of Salmonella typhimurium (Ames assay) without metabolic activation.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Isoniazid has been shown to have an embryocidal effect in rats and rabbits when given orally during pregnancy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Isoniazid was not teratogenic in reproduction studies in mice, rats, and rabbits.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Isoniazid should be used as a treatment for active tuberculosis during pregnancy because the benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The benefit of preventive therapy also should be weighed against a possible risk to the fetus.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Preventive therapy generally should be started after delivery to prevent putting the fetus at risk of exposure; the low levels of isoniazid in breast milk do not threaten the neonate.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Since isoniazid is known to cross the placental barrier, neonates of isoniazid-treated mothers should be carefully observed for any evidence of adverse effects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The small concentrations of isoniazid in breast milk do not produce toxicity in the nursing newborn; therefore, breast feeding should not be discouraged.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, because levels of isoniazid are so low in breast milk, they can not be relied upon for prophylaxis or therapy of nursing infants.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Isoniazid acts against actively growing tubercle bacilli.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Within one to two hours after oral administration, isoniazid produces peak blood levels which decline to 50 percent or less within six hours.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It diffuses readily into all body fluids (cerebrospinal, pleural, and ascitic), tissues, organs, and excreta (saliva, sputum, and feces).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The drug also passes through the placental barrier and into milk in concentrations comparable to those in the plasma.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	From 50 to 70 percent of a dose of isoniazid is excreted in the urine in 24 hours.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Isoniazid is metabolized primarily by acetylation and dehydrazination.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The rate of acetylation is genetically determined.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Approximately 50 percent of Blacks and Caucasians are slow acetylators and the rest are rapid acetylators; the majority of Eskimos and Orientals are rapid acetylators.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The rate of acetylation does not significantly alter the effectiveness of isoniazid therapy when dosage is administered daily.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, slow acetylation may lead to higher blood levels of the drug and thus an increase in toxic reactions.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Pyridoxine (B6) deficiency is sometimes observed in adults with high doses of isoniazid and is considered probably due to its competition with pyridoxal phosphate for the enzyme apotryptophanase.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Isoniazid inhibits the synthesis of mycolic acids, an essential component of the bacterial cell wall.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	At therapeutic levels isoniazid is bacteriocidal against actively growing intracellular and extracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis organisms.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Isoniazid resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli develop rapidly when isoniazid monotherapy is administered.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Two standardized in vitro susceptibility methods are available for testing isoniazid against Mycobacterium tuberculosis organisms.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The agar proportion method (CDC or NCCLS M24-P) utilizes middlebrook 7H10 medium impregnated with isoniazid at two final concentrations, 0.2 and 1.0 mcg/mL.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	MIC99 values are calculated by comparing the quantity of organisms growing in the medium containing drug to the control cultures.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Mycobacterial growth in the presence of drug <U+2265>1% of the control indicates resistance.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The radiometric broth method employs the BACTEC 460 machine to compare the growth index from untreated control cultures to cultures grown in the presence of 0.2 and 1.0 mcg/mL of isoniazid.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Strict adherence to the manufacturers instructions for sample processing and data interpretation is required for this assay.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates with an MIC99 <U+2264>0.2 mcg/mL are considered to be susceptible to isoniazid.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Susceptibility test results obtained by the two different methods discussed above cannot be compared unless equivalent drug concentrations are evaluated.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The clinical relevance of in vitro susceptibility for mycobacterium species other than M. tuberculosis using either the BACTEC or the proportion method has not been determined.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	SYSTEMIC ABSORPTION OF NEOMYCIN OCCURS FOLLOWING ORAL ADMINISTRATION AND TOXIC REACTIONS MAY OCCUR.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients treated with neomycin should be under close clinical observation because of the potential toxicity associated with their use.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	NEUROTOXICITY (INCLUDING OTOTOXICITY) AND NEPHROTOXICITY FOLLOWING THE ORAL USE OF NEOMYCIN SULFATE HAVE BEEN REPORTED, EVEN WHEN USED IN RECOMMENDED DOSES.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	THE POTENTIAL FOR NEPHROTOXICITY, PERMANENT BILATERAL AUDITORY OTOTOXICITY AND SOMETIMES VESTIBULAR TOXICITY IS PRESENT IN PATIENTS WITH NORMAL RENAL FUNCTION WHEN TREATED WITH HIGHER DOSES OF NEOMYCIN AND/OR FOR LONGER PERIODS THAN RECOMMENDED.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Serial, vestibular and audiometric tests, as well as tests of renal function, should be performed (especially in high-risk patients).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	THE RISK OF NEPHROTOXICITY AND OTOTOXICITY IS GREATER IN PATIENTS WITH IMPAIRED RENAL FUNCTION.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Ototoxicity is often delayed in onset and patients developing cochlear damage will not have symptoms during therapy to warn them of developing eighth nerve destruction and total or partial deafness may occur long after neomycin has been discontinued.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Neuromuscular blockage and respiratory paralysis have been reported following the oral use of neomycin.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The possibility of the occurrence of neuromuscular blockage and respiratory paralysis should be considered if neomycin is administered, especially to patients receiving anesthetics, neuromuscular blocking agents such as tubocurarine, succinylcholine, decamethonium, or in patients receiving massive transfusions of citrate anticoagulated blood.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If blockage occurs, calcium salts may reverse these phenomena but mechanical respiratory assistance may be necessary.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concurrent and/or sequential systemic, oral or topical use of other aminoglycosides, including paromomycin and other potentially nephrotoxic and/or neurotoxic drugs such as bacitracin, cisplatin, vancomycin, amphotericin B, polymyxin B, colistin and viomycin, should be avoided because the toxicity may be additive.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Other factors which increase the risk of toxicity are advanced age and dehydration.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The concurrent use of neomycin with potent diuretics such as ethacrynic acid or furosemide should be avoided, since certain diuretics by themselves may cause ototoxicity.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Neomycin sulfate oral preparations are contraindicated in the presence of intestinal obstruction and in individuals with a history of hypersensitivity to the drug.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients with a history of hypersensitivity or serious toxic reaction to other aminoglycosides may have a cross-sensitivity to neomycin.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Neomycin sulfate oral preparations are contraindicated in patients with inflammatory or ulcerative gastrointestinal disease because of the potential for enhanced gastrointestinal absorption of neomycin.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	To minimize the risk of toxicity, use the lowest possible dose and the shortest possible treatment period to control the condition.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Treatment for periods longer than two weeks is not recommended.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For use as an adjunct in the management of hepatic coma, the recommended dose is 4 to 12 grams per day given in the following regimen: Withdraw protein from diet.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Give supportive therapy, including blood products, as indicated.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Give neomycin sulfate tablets in doses of 4 to 12 grams of neomycin sulfate per day (eight to 24 tablets) in divided doses.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Treatment should be continued over a period of five to six days, during which time protein should be returned incrementally to the diet.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If less potentially toxic drugs cannot be used for chronic hepatic insufficiency, neomycin in doses of up to four grams daily (eight tablets per day) may be necessary.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The risk for the development of neomycin-induced toxicity progressively increases when treatment must be extended to preserve the life of a patient with hepatic encephalopathy who has failed to fully respond.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Frequent periodic monitoring of these patients to ascertain the presence of drug toxicity is mandatory.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Also, neomycin serum concentrations should be monitored to avoid potentially toxic levels.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The benefits to the patient should be weighed against the risks of nephrotoxicity, permanent ototoxicity and neuromuscular blockade following the accumulation of neomycin in the tissues.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Listed below is an example of a recommended bowel preparation regimen.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A proposed surgery time of 8:00 a.m. has been used.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Pre-op Day 3: Minimum residue or clear liquid diet.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Bisacodyl, 1 tablet orally at 6:00 p.m. Pre-op Day 2: Minimum residue or clear liquid diet.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Magnesium sulfate, 30 mL, 50% solution (15 g) orally at 10:00 a.m., 2:00 p.m., and 6:00 p.m. Enema at 7:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. Pre-op Day 1: Clear liquid diet.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Magnesium sulfate, 30 mL, 50% solution (15 g) orally at 10:00 a.m., and 2:00 p.m. Neomycin sulfate (1 g) and erythromycin base (1 g) orally at 1:00 p.m., 2:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. No enema.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Day of Operation: Patient evacuates rectum at 6:30 a.m. for scheduled operation at 8:00 a.m.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Caution should be taken in concurrent or serial use of other neurotoxic and/or nephrotoxic drugs because of possible enhancement of the nephrotoxicity and/or ototoxicity of neomycin.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Caution should also be taken in concurrent or serial use of other amino-glycosides and polymyxins because they may enhance neomycin<U+2019>s nephrotoxicity and/or ototoxicity and potentiate neomycin sulfate<U+2019>s neuromuscular blocking effects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, digoxin serum levels should be monitored.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Oral neomycin sulfate may enhance the effect of coumarin in anticoagulants by decreasing vitamin K availability.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Prescribing Neomycin Sulfate Tablets USP in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	As with other antibiotics, use of oral neomycin may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, particularly fungi.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	An in vitro study indicates that alvimopan is not a substrate of CYP enzymes.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, concomitant administration of ENTEREG with inducers or inhibitors of CYP enzymes is unlikely to alter the metabolism of alvimopan.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Based on in vitro data, ENTEREG is unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of coadministered drugs through inhibition of CYP isoforms such as 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 3A4, 2D6, and 2E1 or induction of CYP isoforms such as 1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, and 3A4.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Dosage adjustment for intravenously administered morphine is not necessary when it is coadministered with alvimopan.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A population pharmacokinetic analysis suggests that the pharmacokinetics of alvimopan were not affected by concomitant administration of acid blockers or antibiotics.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	No dosage adjustments are necessary in patients taking acid blockers or antibiotics.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A higher number of myocardial infarctions was reported in patients treated with alvimopan 0.5 mg twice daily compared with placebo in a 12-month study in patients treated with opioids for chronic non-cancer pain, although a causal relationship with long-term use has not been established.

Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In this study, the majority of myocardial infarctions occurred between 1 and 4 months after initiation of treatment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Only hospitals that have enrolled in and met all of the requirements for the E.A.S.E. program may use ENTEREG.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Program, an authorized hospital representative must acknowledge that: hospital staff who prescribe, dispense, or administer ENTEREG have been provided the educational materials on the need to limit use of ENTEREG to short-term, inpatient use; patients will not receive more than 15 doses of ENTEREG; and ENTEREG will not be dispensed to patients after they have been discharged from the hospital.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Further information is available at www.ENTEREGREMS.com or 1-800-278-0340.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients recently exposed to opioids are expected to be more sensitive to the effects of <U+03BC>-opioid receptor antagonists, such as ENTEREG.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Since ENTEREG acts peripherally, clinical signs and symptoms of increased sensitivity would be related to the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients receiving more than 3 doses of an opioid within the week prior to surgery were not studied in the postoperative ileus clinical trials.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, if ENTEREG is administered to these patients, they should be monitored for gastrointestinal adverse reactions.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients with severe hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of serious adverse reactions (including dose-related serious adverse reactions) because up to 10-fold higher plasma levels of drug have been observed in such patients compared with patients with normal hepatic function.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the use of ENTEREG is not recommended in this population.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	No studies have been conducted in patients with end-stage renal disease.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Alvimopan is a selective antagonist of the cloned human <U+03BC>-opioid receptor with a Ki of 0.4 nM (0.2 ng/mL) and no measurable opioid-agonist effects in standard pharmacologic assays.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The dissociation of [3H]-alvimopan from the human <U+03BC>-opioid receptor is slower than that of other opioid ligands, consistent with its higher affinity for the receptor.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Postoperative ileus is the impairment of gastrointestinal motility after intra-abdominal surgery or other, non-abdominal surgeries.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Postoperative ileus affects all segments of the gastrointestinal tract and may last from 5 to 6 days, or even longer.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This may potentially delay gastrointestinal recovery and hospital discharge until its resolution.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is characterized by abdominal distention and bloating, nausea, vomiting, pain, accumulation of gas and fluids in the bowel, and delayed passage of flatus and defecation.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Postoperative ileus is the result of a multifactorial process that includes inhibitory sympathetic input and release of hormones, neurotransmitters, and other mediators (e.g., endogenous opioids).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A component of postoperative ileus also results from an inflammatory reaction and the effects of opioid analgesics.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Morphine and other <U+03BC>-opioid receptor agonists are universally used for the treatment of acute postsurgical pain; however, they are known to have an inhibitory effect on gastrointestinal motility and may prolong the duration of postoperative ileus.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Following oral administration, alvimopan antagonizes the peripheral effects of opioids on gastrointestinal motility and secretion by competitively binding to gastrointestinal tract <U+03BC>-opioid receptors.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The antagonism produced by alvimopan at opioid receptors is evident in isolated guinea pig ileum preparations in which alvimopan competitively antagonizes the effects of morphine on contractility.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Alvimopan achieves this selective gastrointestinal opioid antagonism without reversing the central analgesic effects of <U+03BC>-opioid agonists.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In an exploratory study in healthy volunteers, alvimopan 12 mg administered twice a day reduced the delay in small and large bowel transit induced by codeine 30 mg administered 4 times a day, as measured by gastrointestinal scintigraphy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In the same study, concomitant alvimopan did not reduce the delay in gastric emptying induced by codeine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a study designed to evaluate potential effects on cardiac conduction, alvimopan did not cause clinically significant QTc prolongation at doses up to 24 mg twice daily (twice the approved dosage regimen) for 7 days.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The potential for QTc effects at higher doses has not been studied.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Following oral administration of alvimopan, an amide hydrolysis compound is present in the systemic circulation, which is considered a product exclusively of intestinal flora metabolism.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Absorption: Following oral administration of ENTEREG capsules in healthy volunteers, plasma alvimopan concentration peaked at approximately 2 hours postdose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	No significant accumulation in alvimopan concentration was observed following twice daily (BID) dosing.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The mean peak plasma concentration was 10.98 (<U+00B1>6.43) ng/mL and mean AUC0<U+2013>12h was 40.2 (<U+00B1>22.5) ng<U+2219>h/mL after dosing of alvimopan at 12 mg BID for 5 days.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The absolute bioavailability was estimated to be 6% (range, 1% to 19%).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There was a delay in the appearance of the 'metabolite', which had a median Tmax of 36 hours following administration of a single dose of alvimopan.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concentrations of the 'metabolite' were highly variable between subjects and within a subject.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The 'metabolite' accumulated after multiple doses of ENTEREG.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The mean Cmax for the 'metabolite' after alvimopan 12 mg twice daily for 5 days was 35.73 <U+00B1> 35.29 ng/mL.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concentrations of alvimopan and its 'metabolite' are higher (~1.9-fold and ~1.4-fold, respectively) in postoperative ileus patients than in healthy volunteers.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The Cmax and AUC were decreased by approximately 38% and 21%, respectively, and the Tmax was prolonged by approximately 1 hour.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The clinical significance of this decreased bioavailability is unknown.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In postoperative ileus clinical trials, the preoperative dose of ENTEREG was administered in a fasting state.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Subsequent doses were given without regard to meals.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Distribution: The steady-state volume of distribution of alvimopan was estimated to be 30<U+00B1>10 L. Plasma protein binding of alvimopan and its 'metabolite' was independent of concentration over ranges observed clinically and averaged 80% and 94%, respectively.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Both alvimopan and the 'metabolite' were bound to albumin and not to alpha-1 acid glycoprotein.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Metabolism and Elimination: In vitro data suggest that alvimopan is not a substrate of CYP enzymes.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The average plasma clearance for alvimopan was 402 (<U+00B1>89) mL/min.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Renal excretion accounted for approximately 35% of total clearance.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There was no evidence that hepatic metabolism was a significant route for alvimopan elimination.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Biliary secretion was considered the primary pathway for alvimopan elimination.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Unabsorbed drug and unchanged alvimopan resulting from biliary excretion were then hydrolyzed to its 'metabolite' by gut microflora.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The 'metabolite' was eliminated in the feces and in the urine as unchanged 'metabolite', the glucuronide conjugate of the 'metabolite', and other minor metabolites.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The mean terminal phase half-life of alvimopan after multiple oral doses of ENTEREG ranged from 10 to 17 hours.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The terminal half-life of the 'metabolite' ranged from 10 to 18 hours.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Specific Populations: Age: The pharmacokinetics of alvimopan, but not its 'metabolite', were related to age, but this effect was not clinically significant and does not warrant dosage adjustment based on increased age.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Race: The pharmacokinetic characteristics of alvimopan were not affected by Hispanic or Black race.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Plasma 'metabolite' concentrations were lower in Black and Hispanic patients (by 43% and 82%, respectively) than in Caucasian patients following alvimopan administration.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These changes are not considered to be clinically significant in surgical patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Japanese healthy male volunteers had an approximately 2-fold increase in plasma alvimopan concentrations, but no change in 'metabolite' pharmacokinetics.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The pharmacokinetics of alvimopan have not been studied in subjects of other East Asian ancestry.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dosage adjustment in Japanese patients is not required.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Gender: There was no effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of alvimopan or the 'metabolite'.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hepatic Impairment: Exposure to alvimopan following a single 12 mg dose tended to be higher (1.5- to 2-fold, on average) in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (as defined by Child-Pugh Class A and B, n = 8 each) compared with healthy controls (n = 4).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There were no consistent effects on the Cmax or half-life of alvimopan in patients with hepatic impairment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, 2 of 16 patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment had longer than expected half-lives of alvimopan, indicating that some accumulation may occur upon multiple dosing.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The Cmax of the 'metabolite' tended to be more variable in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment than in matched normal subjects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A study of 3 patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C), indicated similar alvimopan exposure in 2 patients and an approximately 10-fold increase in Cmax and exposure in 1 patient with severe hepatic impairment when compared with healthy control volunteers.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Renal Impairment: There was no relationship between renal function (i.e., creatinine clearance [CrCl]) and plasma alvimopan pharmacokinetics (Cmax, AUC, or half-life) in patients with mild (CrCl 51<U+2013>80 mL/min), moderate (CrCl 31<U+2013>50 mL/min), or severe (CrCl <30 mL/min) renal impairment (n = 6 each).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Renal clearance of alvimopan was related to renal function; however, because renal clearance was only a small fraction (35%) of the total clearance, renal impairment had a small effect on the apparent oral clearance of alvimopan.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The half-lives of alvimopan were comparable in the mild, moderate, and control renal impairment groups but longer in the severe renal impairment group.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Exposure to the 'metabolite' tended to be 2- to 5-fold higher in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment compared with patients with mild renal impairment or control subjects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thus, there may be accumulation of alvimopan and 'metabolite' in patients with severe renal impairment receiving multiple doses of ENTEREG.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients with end-stage renal disease were not studied.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Crohn's Disease: There was no relationship between disease activity in patients with Crohn's disease (measured as Crohn's Disease Activity Index or bowel movement frequency) and alvimopan pharmacokinetics (AUC or Cmax).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients with active or quiescent Crohn's disease had increased variability in alvimopan pharmacokinetics, and exposure tended to be 2-fold higher in patients with quiescent disease than in those with active disease or in normal subjects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concentrations of the 'metabolite' were lower in patients with Crohn's disease.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drug Interactions: Potential for Drugs to Affect Alvimopan Pharmacokinetics: Concomitant administration of ENTEREG with inducers or inhibitors of CYP enzymes is unlikely to alter the metabolism of alvimopan because ENTEREG is metabolized mainly by non-CYP enzyme pathway.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	No clinical studies have been performed to assess the effect of concomitant administration of inducers or inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzymes on alvimopan pharmacokinetics.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In vitro studies suggest that alvimopan and its 'metabolite' are substrates for p-glycoprotein.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A population pharmacokinetic analysis did not reveal any evidence that alvimopan or 'metabolite' pharmacokinetics were influenced by concomitant medications that are mild-to-moderate p-glycoprotein inhibitors.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	No clinical studies of concomitant administration of alvimopan and strong inhibitors of p-glycoprotein (e.g., verapamil, cyclosporine, amiodarone, itraconazole, quinine, spironolactone, quinidine, diltiazem, bepridil) have been conducted.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, plasma concentrations of the 'metabolite' were lower in patients receiving acid blockers or preoperative oral antibiotics (49% and 81%, respectively).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	No dosage adjustments are necessary in these patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Potential for Alvimopan to Affect the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs: Alvimopan and its 'metabolite' are not inhibitors of CYP 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 3A4, 2D6, and 2E1 in vitro at concentrations far in excess of those observed clinically.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Alvimopan and its 'metabolite' are not inducers of CYP 1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, and 3A4.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In vitro studies also suggest that alvimopan and its 'metabolite' are not inhibitors of p-glycoprotein.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These in vitro findings suggest that ENTEREG is unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of coadministered drugs through inhibition or induction of CYP enzymes or inhibition of p-glycoprotein.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria can also be produced in some patients by systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids while on treatment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients applying a potent topical steroid to a large surface area or to areas under occlusion should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This may be done by using the ACTH stimulation, A.M. plasma cortisol, and urinary free cortisol tests.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent steroid.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Throughout this labeling, epidemiologic studies reported are of two types: retrospective or case control studies and prospective or cohort studies.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Case control studies provide a measure of the relative risk of a disease, namely, a ratio of the incidence of a disease among oral contraceptive users to that among non-users.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The relative risk does not provide information on the actual clinical occurrence of a disease.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cohort studies provide a measure of attributable risk, which is the difference in the incidence of disease between oral contraceptive users and non-users.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The attributable risk does provide information about the actual occurrence of a disease in the population (Adapted from refs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For further information, the reader is referred to a text on epidemiologic methods. a. Thromboembolism An increased risk of thromboembolic and thrombotic disease associated with the use of oral contraceptives is well established.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Case control studies have found the relative risk of users compared to non-users to be 3 for the first episode of superficial venous thromboembolic disease, 4 to 11 for deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, and 1.5 to 6 for women with predisposing conditions for venous thromboembolic disease (2, 3, 19 to 24).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cohort studies have shown the relative risk to be somewhat lower, about 3 for new cases and about 4.5 for new cases requiring hospitalization (25).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The risk of thromboembolic disease associated with oral contraceptives is not related to length of use and disappears after pill use is stopped (2).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Several epidemiologic studies indicate that third generation oral contraceptives, including those containing desogestrel, are associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism than certain second generation oral contraceptives (102 to 104).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In general, these studies indicate an approximate two-fold increased risk, which corresponds to an additional 1 to 2 cases of venous thromboembolism per 10,000 women-years of use.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, data from additional studies have not shown this two-fold increase in risk.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A two- to four-fold increase in relative risk of post-operative thromboembolic complications has been reported with the use of oral contraceptives (9, 26).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The relative risk of venous thrombosis in women who have predisposing conditions is twice that of women without such medical conditions (9, 26).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If feasible, oral contraceptives should be discontinued at least four weeks prior to and for two weeks after elective surgery of a type associated with an increase in risk of thromboembolism and during and following prolonged immobilization.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Since the immediate postpartum period is also associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, oral contraceptives should be started no earlier than four weeks after delivery in women who elect not to breastfeed. b. Myocardial infarction An increased risk of myocardial infarction has been attributed to oral contraceptive use.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This risk is primarily in smokers or women with other underlying risk factors for coronary artery disease such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, morbid obesity, and diabetes.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The relative risk of heart attack for current oral contraceptive users has been estimated to be two to six (4 to 10).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The risk is very low in women under the age of 30.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Smoking in combination with oral contraceptive use has been shown to contribute substantially to the incidence of myocardial infarction in women in their mid-thirties or older with smoking accounting for the majority of excess cases (11).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Mortality rates associated with circulatory disease have been shown to increase substantially in smokers, over the age of 35 and non-smokers over the age of 40 (Table III) among women who use oral contraceptives.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Oral contraceptives may compound the effects of well-known risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemias, age and obesity (13).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In particular, some progestogens are known to decrease HDL cholesterol and cause glucose intolerance, while estrogens may create a state of hyperinsulinism (14 to 18).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Oral contraceptives have been shown to increase blood pressure among users.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Similar effects on risk factors have been associated with an increased risk of heart disease.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. c. Cerebrovascular diseases Oral contraceptives have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (> 35 years), hypertensive women who also smoke.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hypertension was found to be a risk factor for both users and non-users, for both types of strokes, while smoking interacted to increase the risk for hemorrhagic strokes (27 to 29).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a large study, the relative risk of thrombotic strokes has been shown to range from 3 for normotensive users to 14 for users with severe hypertension (30).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The relative risk of hemorrhagic stroke is reported to be 1.2 for non-smokers who used oral contraceptives, 2.6 for smokers who did not use oral contraceptives, 7.6 for smokers who used oral contraceptives, 1.8 for normotensive users and 25.7 for users with severe hypertension (30).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The attributable risk is also greater in older women (3). d. Dose-related risk of vascular disease from oral contraceptives A positive association has been observed between the amount of estrogen and progestogen in oral contraceptives and the risk of vascular disease (31 to 33).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A decline in serum high-density lipoproteins (HDL) has been reported with many progestational agents (14 to 16).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A decline in serum high-density lipoproteins has been associated with an increased incidence of ischemic heart disease.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because estrogens increase HDL cholesterol, the net effect of an oral contraceptive depends on a balance achieved between doses of estrogen and progestogen and the nature and absolute amount of progestogens used in the contraceptives.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The amount of both hormones should be considered in the choice of an oral contraceptive.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Minimizing exposure to estrogen and progestogen is in keeping with good principles of therapeutics.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For any particular estrogen/progestogen combination, the dosage regimen prescribed should be one which contains the least amount of estrogen and progestogen that is compatible with a low failure rate and the needs of the individual patient.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	New acceptors of oral contraceptive agents should be started on preparations containing 0.035 mg or less of estrogen. e. Persistence of risk of vascular disease There are two studies which have shown persistence of risk of vascular disease for ever-users of oral contraceptives.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a study in the United States, the risk of developing myocardial infarction after discontinuing oral contraceptives persists for at least 9 years for women 40 to 49 years old who had used oral contraceptives for five or more years, but this increased risk was not demonstrated in other age groups (8).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In another study in Great Britain, the risk of developing cerebrovascular disease persisted for at least 6 years after discontinuation of oral contraceptives, although excess risk was very small (34).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, both studies were performed with oral contraceptive formulations containing 50 micrograms or more of estrogen.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Table III One study gathered data from a variety of sources which have estimated the mortality rate associated with different methods of contraception at different ages (Table IV).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These estimates include the combined risk of death associated with contraceptive methods plus the risk attributable to pregnancy in the event of method failure.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Each method of contraception has its specific benefits and risks.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The study concluded that with the exception of oral contraceptive users 35 and older who smoke and 40 and older who do not smoke, mortality associated with all methods of birth control is low and below that associated with childbirth.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The observation of a possible increase in risk of mortality with age for oral contraceptive users is based on data gathered in the 1970<U+2019>s - but not reported until 1983 (35).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, current clinical practice involves the use of lower estrogen formulations combined with careful consideration of risk factors.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because of these changes in practice and, also, because of some limited new data which suggest that the risk of cardiovascular disease with the use of oral contraceptives may now be less than previously observed (100, 101), the Fertility and Maternal Health Drugs Advisory Committee was asked to review the topic in 1989.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The Committee concluded that although cardiovascular disease risks may be increased with oral contraceptive use after age 40 in healthy non-smoking women (even with the newer low-dose formulations), there are also greater potential health risks associated with pregnancy in older women and with the alternative surgical and medical procedures which may be necessary if such women do not have access to effective and acceptable means of contraception.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the Committee recommended that the benefits of low-dose oral contraceptive use by healthy non-smoking women over 40 may outweigh the possible risks.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Of course, older women, as all women who take oral contraceptives, should take the lowest possible dose formulation that is effective.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Numerous epidemiologic studies have been performed on the incidence of breast, endometrial, ovarian, and cervical cancer in women using oral contraceptives.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	While there are conflicting reports, most studies suggest that the use of oral contraceptives is not associated with an overall increase in the risk of developing breast cancer.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Some studies have reported an increased relative risk of developing breast cancer, particularly at a younger age.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This increased relative risk appears to be related to duration of use (36 to 43, 79 to 89).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Some studies suggest that oral contraceptive use has been associated with an increase in the risk of cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia in some populations of women (45 to 48).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, there continues to be controversy about the extent to which such findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Benign hepatic adenomas are associated with oral contraceptive use, although the incidence of benign tumors is rare in the United States.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Indirect calculations have estimated the attributable risk to be in the range of 3.3 cases/100,000 for users, a risk that increases after four or more years of use especially with oral contraceptives of higher dose (49).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rupture of rare, benign, hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage (50, 51).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Studies from Britain have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (52 to 54) in long-term (> 8 years) oral contraceptive users.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, these cancers are extremely rare in the U.S. and the attributable risk (the excess incidence) of liver cancers in oral contraceptive users approaches less than one per million users.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During clinical trials with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen that contains ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, ALT elevations greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), including some cases greater than 20 times the ULN, were significantly more frequent in women using ethinyl estradiol-containing medications such as COCs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Discontinue Kariva prior to starting therapy with the combination drug regimen ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Kariva can be restarted approximately 2 weeks following completion of treatment with the combination drug regimen.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There have been clinical case reports of retinal thrombosis associated with the use of oral contraceptives.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Oral contraceptives should be discontinued if there is unexplained partial or complete loss of vision; onset of proptosis or diplopia; papilledema; or retinal vascular lesions.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic measures should be undertaken immediately.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Extensive epidemiologic studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy (55 to 57).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects are concerned (55, 56, 58, 59), when oral contraceptives are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Oral contraceptives should not be used during pregnancy to treat threatened or habitual abortion.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is recommended that for any patient who has missed two consecutive periods, pregnancy should be ruled out before continuing oral contraceptive use.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule, the possibility of pregnancy should be considered at the first missed period.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Oral contraceptive use should be discontinued until pregnancy is ruled out.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Earlier studies have reported an increased lifetime relative risk of gallbladder surgery in users of oral contraceptives and estrogens (60, 61).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	More recent studies, however, have shown that the relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among oral contraceptive users may be minimal (62 to 64).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The recent findings of minimal risk may be related to the use of oral contraceptive formulations containing lower hormonal doses of estrogens and progestogens.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Oral contraceptives have been shown to cause a decrease in glucose tolerance in a significant percentage of users (17).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Oral contraceptives containing greater than 75 micrograms of estrogens cause hyperinsulinism, while lower doses of estrogen cause less glucose intolerance (65).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Progestogens increase insulin secretion and create insulin resistance, this effect varying with different progestational agents (17, 66).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, in the non-diabetic woman, oral contraceptives appear to have no effect on fasting blood glucose (67).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because of these demonstrated effects, prediabetic and diabetic women should be carefully monitored while taking oral contraceptives.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A small proportion of women will have persistent hypertriglyceridemia while on the pill.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	), changes in serum triglycerides and lipoprotein levels have been reported in oral contraceptive users.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking oral contraceptives (68) and this increase is more likely in older oral contraceptive users (69) and with continued use (61).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Data from the Royal College of General Practitioners (12) and subsequent randomized trials have shown that the incidence of hypertension increases with increasing quantities of progestogens.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Women with a history of hypertension or hypertension-related diseases, or renal disease (70) should be encouraged to use another method of contraception.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If women elect to use oral contraceptives, they should be monitored closely and if significant elevation of blood pressure occurs, oral contraceptives should be discontinued.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For most women, elevated blood pressure will return to normal after stopping oral contraceptives (69), and there is no difference in the occurrence of hypertension between ever- and never-users (68, 70, 71).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The onset or exacerbation of migraine or development of headache with a new pattern which is recurrent, persistent, or severe requires discontinuation of oral contraceptives and evaluation of the cause.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Breakthrough bleeding and spotting are sometimes encountered in patients on oral contraceptives, especially during the first three months of use.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Non-hormonal causes should be considered and adequate diagnostic measures taken to rule out malignancy or pregnancy in the event of breakthrough bleeding, as in the case of any abnormal vaginal bleeding.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If pathology has been excluded, time or a change to another formulation may solve the problem.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In the event of amenorrhea, pregnancy should be ruled out.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was pre-existent.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Ectopic as well as intrauterine pregnancy may occur in contraceptive failures.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Combination oral contraceptives act by suppression of gonadotropins.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Although the primary mechanism of this action is inhibition of ovulation, other alterations include changes in the cervical mucus (which increase the difficulty of sperm entry into the uterus) and the endometrium (which reduce the likelihood of implantation).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Receptor binding studies, as well as studies in animals, have shown that etonogestrel, the biologically active metabolite of desogestrel, combines high progestational activity with minimal intrinsic androgenicity (91, 92).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The relevance of this latter finding in humans is unknown.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Desogestrel is rapidly and almost completely absorbed and converted into etonogestrel, its biologically active metabolite.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Following oral administration, the relative bioavailability of desogestrel compared to a solution, as measured by serum levels of etonogestrel, is approximately 100%.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Kariva (desogestrel/ethinyl estradiol and ethinyl estradiol) Tablets provide two different regimens of ethinyl estradiol; 0.02 mg in the combination tablet [white] as well as 0.01 mg in the light-blue tablet.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Ethinyl estradiol is rapidly and almost completely absorbed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	After a single dose of Kariva combination tablet [white], the relative bioavailability of ethinyl estradiol is approximately 93% while the relative bioavailability of the 0.01 mg tablet [light-blue] is 99%.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effect of food on the bioavailability of Kariva tablets following oral administration has not been evaluated.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The pharmacokinetics of etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol following multiple dose administration of Kariva tablets were determined during the third cycle in 17 subjects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Plasma concentrations of etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol reached steady state by Day 21.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The AUC(0<U+2013>24) for etonogestrel at steady state on Day 21 was approximately 2.2 times higher than AUC(0<U+2013>24) on Day 1 of the third cycle.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Ethinyl estradiol is approximately 98.3% bound, mainly to plasma albumin.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Ethinyl estradiol does not bind to SHBG, but induces SHBG synthesis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Desogestrel, in combination with ethinyl estradiol, does not counteract the estrogen-induced increase in SHBG, resulting in lower serum levels of free testosterone (96 to 99).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Desogestrel Desogestrel is rapidly and completely metabolized by hydroxylation in the intestinal mucosa and on first pass through the liver to etonogestrel.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Other metabolites (i.e., 3a-OH-desogestrel, 3<U+00C3><U+0178>-OH-desogestrel, and 3a-OH-5a-H-desogestrel) with no pharmacologic actions also have been identified and these metabolites may undergo glucuronide and sulfate conjugation.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Ethinyl estradiol Ethinyl estradiol is subject to a significant degree of presystemic conjugation (phase II metabolism).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Ethinyl estradiol escaping gut wall conjugation undergoes phase I metabolism and hepatic conjugation (phase II metabolism).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Hydroxyzine, when administered to the pregnant mouse, rat, and rabbit induced fetal abnormalities in the rat and mouse at doses substantially above the human therapeutic range.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Clinical data in human beings are inadequate to establish safety in early pregnancy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Until such data are available, hydroxyzine is contraindicated in early pregnancy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hydroxyzine is contraindicated for patients who have shown a previous hypersensitivity to any component of this medication.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	As a sedative when used as a premedication and following general anesthesia: 50 to 100 mg for adults and 0.6 mg/kg of body weight in children.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When treatment is initiated by the intramuscular route of administration, subsequent doses may be administered orally.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	As with all potent medication, the dosage should be adjusted according to the patient<U+2019>s response to therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	THE POTENTIATING ACTION OF HYDROXYZINE MUST BE CONSIDERED WHEN THE DRUG IS USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DEPRESSANTS SUCH AS NARCOTICS, NON-NARCOTIC ANALGESICS AND BARBITURATES.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, when central nervous system depressants are administered concomitantly with hydroxyzine their dosage should be reduced.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	QT Prolongation/Torsade de Pointes (TdP): Cases of QT prolongation and Torsade de Pointes have been reported during post-marketing use of hydroxyzine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The majority of reports occurred in patients with other risk factors for QT prolongation/TdP (pre-existing heart disease, electrolyte imbalances or concomitant arrhythmogenic drug use).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, hydroxyzine should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for QT prolongation, congenital long QT syndrome, a family history of long QT syndrome, other conditions that predispose to QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia, as well as recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure, and bradyarrhythmias.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Caution is recommended during the concomitant use of drugs known to prolong the QT interval.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These include Class 1A (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmics, certain antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, clozapine, quetiapine, chlorpromazine), certain antidepressants (e.g., citalopram, fluoxetine), certain antibiotics (e.g., azithromycin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin); and others (e.g., pentamidine, methadone, ondansetron, droperidol).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Since drowsiness may occur with use of this drug, patients should be warned of this possibility and cautioned against driving a car or operating dangerous machinery while taking hydroxyzine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients should also be advised against the simultaneous use of other CNS depressant drugs, and cautioned that the effects of alcohol may be increased.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A determination has not been made whether controlled clinical studies of hydroxyzine included sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to define a difference in response from younger subjects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The extent of renal excretion of hydroxyzine has not been determined.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selections.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Sedating drugs may cause confusion and over sedation in the elderly; elderly patients generally should be started on low doses of hydroxyzine and observed closely.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hydroxyzine may rarely cause acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), a serious skin reaction characterized by fever and numerous small, superficial, non-follicular, sterile pustules, arising within large areas of edematous erythema.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Inform patients about the signs of AGEP, and discontinue hydroxyzine at the first appearance of a skin rash, worsening of pre-existing skin reactions which hydroxyzine may be used to treat, or any other sign of hypersensitivity.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If signs or symptoms suggest AGEP, use of hydroxyzine should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Avoid cetirizine or levocetirizine in patients who have experienced AGEP or other hypersensitivity reactions with hydroxyzine, due to the risk of cross-sensitivity.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Since many drugs are so excreted, hydroxyzine should not be given to nursing mothers.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hydroxyzine hydrochloride is unrelated chemically to the phenothiazines, reserpine, meprobamate or the benzodiazepines.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hydroxyzine is not a cortical depressant, but its action may be due to a suppression of activity in certain key regions of the subcortical area of the central nervous system.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Primary skeletal muscle relaxation has been demonstrated experimentally.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Bronchodilator activity, and antihistaminic and analgesic effects have been demonstrated experimentally and confirmed clinically.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An antiemetic effect, both by the apomorphine test and the veriloid test, has been demonstrated.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Pharmacological and clinical studies indicate that hydroxyzine in therapeutic dosage does not increase gastric secretion or acidity and in most cases has mild antisecretory activity.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hydroxyzine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and hydroxyzine<U+2019>s clinical effects are usually noted within 15 to 30 minutes after oral administration.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	BONIVA is contraindicated in patients with the following conditions: Abnormalities of the esophagus which delay esophageal emptying such as stricture or achalasia Inability to stand or sit upright for at least 60 minutes Hypocalcemia Known hypersensitivity to BONIVA or to any of its excipients.

5	Take one 150 mg tablet once monthly on the same day each month (2.1) Instruct patient to: (2.2) Swallow whole tablet with 6-8 oz of plain water only, at least 60 minutes before the first food, beverage, or medication of day.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Avoid lying down for at least 60 minutes after taking BONIVA.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Do not eat, drink (except for water), or take other medication for 60 minutes after taking BONIVA.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Take supplemental calcium and vitamin D if dietary intake inadequate (2.3) The dose of BONIVA is one 150 mg tablet taken once monthly on the same date each month.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Instruct Patients to do the following: Take BONIVA at least 60 minutes before the first food or drink (other than water) of the day or before taking any oral medication or supplementation, including calcium, antacids, or vitamins to maximize absorption and clinical benefit,.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Avoid the use of water with supplements including mineral water because they may have a higher concentration of calcium.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Swallow BONIVA tablets whole with a full glass of plain water (6 to 8 oz) while standing or sitting in an upright position to reduce the potential for esophageal irritation.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Avoid lying down for 60 minutes after taking BONIVA.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Do not chew or suck the tablet because of a potential for oropharyngeal ulceration.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Do not eat, drink anything except plain water, or take other medications for at least 60 minutes after taking BONIVA.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Instruct patients to take supplemental calcium and vitamin D if their dietary intake is inadequate.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If the once-monthly dose is missed, instruct patients to do the following: If the next scheduled BONIVA day is more than 7 days away, take one BONIVA 150 mg tablet in the morning following the date that it is remembered.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If the next scheduled BONIVA day is only 1 to 7 days away, wait until the subsequent month's scheduled BONIVA day to take their tablet.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For subsequent monthly doses for both of the above scenarios, instruct patients to return to their original schedule by taking one BONIVA 150 mg tablet every month on their previous chosen day.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Do not take within 60 minutes of dosing (7.1) Use caution when co-prescribing aspirin/nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that may worsen gastrointestinal irritation.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, instruct patients to take BONIVA at least 60 minutes before any oral medications, including medications containing multivalent cations (such as antacids, supplements or vitamins).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Also, patients should wait at least 60 minutes after dosing before taking any other oral medications.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because aspirin, NSAIDs, and bisphosphonates are all associated with gastrointestinal irritation, caution should be exercised in the concomitant use of aspirin or NSAIDs with BONIVA.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Bisphosphonates are known to interfere with the use of bone-imaging agents.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Specific studies with ibandronate have not been performed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Upper gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions can occur.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Instruct patients to follow dosing instructions and discontinue use if new or worsening symptoms occur.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hypocalcemia may worsen during treatment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Severe Bone, Joint, and Muscle Pain may occur.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Consider discontinuing use if symptoms develop.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Osteonecrosis of the Jaw has been reported.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Atypical Femur Fractures have been reported.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients with new thigh or groin pain should be evaluated to rule out a femoral fracture.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	BONIVA, like other bisphosphonates administered orally, may cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because of these possible irritant effects and a potential for worsening of the underlying disease, caution should be used when BONIVA is given to patients with active upper gastrointestinal problems (such as known Barrett's esophagus, dysphagia, other esophageal diseases, gastritis, duodenitis or ulcers).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Esophageal adverse experiences, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcers and esophageal erosions, occasionally with bleeding and rarely followed by esophageal stricture or perforation, have been reported in patients receiving treatment with oral bisphosphonates.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In some cases, these have been severe and required hospitalization.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Physicians should therefore be alert to any signs or symptoms signaling a possible esophageal reaction and patients should be instructed to discontinue BONIVA and seek medical attention if they develop dysphagia, odynophagia, retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The risk of severe esophageal adverse experiences appears to be greater in patients who lie down after taking oral bisphosphonates and/or who fail to swallow it with the recommended full glass (6-8 oz) of water, and/or who continue to take oral bisphosphonates after developing symptoms suggestive of esophageal irritation.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, it is very important that the full dosing instructions are provided to, and understood by, the patient.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In patients who cannot comply with dosing instructions due to mental disability, therapy with BONIVA should be used under appropriate supervision.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There have been post-marketing reports of gastric and duodenal ulcers with oral bisphosphonate use, some severe and with complications, although no increased risk was observed in controlled clinical trials.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hypocalcemia has been reported in patients taking BONIVA.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Treat hypocalcemia and other disturbances of bone and mineral metabolism before starting BONIVA therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking BONIVA and other bisphosphonates.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Consider discontinuing use if severe symptoms develop.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), which can occur spontaneously, is generally associated with tooth extraction and/or local infection with delayed healing, and has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates, including BONIVA.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Known risk factors for osteonecrosis of the jaw include invasive dental procedures (e.g., tooth extraction, dental implants, boney surgery), diagnosis of cancer, concomitant therapies (e.g., chemotherapy, corticosteroids, angiogenesis inhibitors), poor oral hygiene, and co-morbid disorders (e.g., periodontal and/or other pre-existing dental disease, anemia, coagulopathy, infection, ill-fitting dentures).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The risk of ONJ may increase with duration of exposure to bisphosphonates.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For patients requiring invasive dental procedures, discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment may reduce the risk for ONJ.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Clinical judgment of the treating physician and/or oral surgeon should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients who develop osteonecrosis of the jaw while on bisphosphonate therapy should receive care by an oral surgeon.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In these patients, extensive dental surgery to treat ONJ may exacerbate the condition.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Discontinuation of bisphosphonate therapy should be considered based on individual benefit/risk assessment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Atypical, low-energy, or low-trauma fractures of the femoral shaft have been reported in bisphosphonate-treated patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Causality has not been established as these fractures also occur in osteoporotic patients who have not been treated with bisphosphonates.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Atypical femur fractures most commonly occur with minimal or no trauma to the affected area.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	They may be bilateral and many patients report prodromal pain in the affected area, usually presenting as dull, aching thigh pain, weeks to months before a complete fracture occurs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A number of reports note that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone) at the time of fracture.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Any patient with a history of bisphosphonate exposure who presents with thigh or groin pain should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients presenting with an atypical fracture should also be assessed for symptoms and signs of fracture in the contralateral limb.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Interruption of bisphosphonate therapy should be considered, pending a risk/benefit assessment, on an individual basis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	BONIVA is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of less than 30 mL/min).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The action of ibandronate on bone tissue is based on its affinity for hydroxyapatite, which is part of the mineral matrix of bone.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Ibandronate inhibits osteoclast activity and reduces bone resorption and turnover.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In postmenopausal women, it reduces the elevated rate of bone turnover, leading to, on average, a net gain in bone mass.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Osteoporosis is characterized by decreased bone mass and increased fracture risk, most commonly at the spine, hip, and wrist.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The diagnosis can be confirmed by a finding of low bone mass, evidence of fracture on x-ray, a history of osteoporotic fracture, or height loss or kyphosis indicative of vertebral fracture.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	While osteoporosis occurs in both men and women, it is most common among women following menopause.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In healthy humans, bone formation and resorption are closely linked; old bone is resorbed and replaced by newly formed bone.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In postmenopausal osteoporosis, bone resorption exceeds bone formation, leading to bone loss and increased risk of fracture.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	After menopause, the risk of fractures of the spine and hip increases; approximately 40% of 50-year-old women will experience an osteoporosis-related fracture during their remaining lifetimes.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	BONIVA produced biochemical changes indicative of dose-dependent inhibition of bone resorption, including decreases of biochemical markers of bone collagen degradation (such as deoxypyridinoline, and cross-linked C-telopeptide of Type I collagen) in the daily dose range of 0.25 mg to 5 mg and once-monthly doses from 100 mg to 150 mg in postmenopausal women.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Treatment with 2.5 mg daily BONIVA resulted in decreases in biochemical markers of bone turnover, including urinary C-terminal telopeptide of Type I collagen (uCTX) and serum osteocalcin, to levels similar to those in premenopausal women.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Changes in markers of bone formation were observed later than changes in resorption markers, as expected, due to the coupled nature of bone resorption and formation.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Treatment with 2.5 mg daily BONIVA decreased levels of uCTX within 1 month of starting treatment and decreased levels of osteocalcin within 3 months.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Bone turnover markers reached a nadir of approximately 64% below baseline values by 6 months of treatment and remained stable with continued treatment for up to 3 years.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Following treatment discontinuation, there is a return to pretreatment baseline rates of elevated bone resorption associated with postmenopausal osteoporosis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a 1-year, study comparing once-monthly vs. once-daily oral dosing regimens, the median decrease from baseline in serum CTX values was -76% for patients treated with the 150 mg once-monthly regimen and -67% for patients treated with the 2.5 mg daily regimen.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a 1-year, prevention study comparing BONIVA 150 mg once-monthly to placebo, the median placebo-subtracted decrease in sCTX was -49.8%.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Absorption The absorption of oral ibandronate occurs in the upper gastrointestinal tract.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Plasma concentrations increase in a dose-linear manner up to 50 mg oral intake and increases nonlinearly above this dose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Following oral dosing, the time to maximum observed plasma ibandronate concentrations ranged from 0.5 to 2 hours (median 1 hour) in fasted healthy postmenopausal women.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The mean oral bioavailability of 2.5 mg ibandronate was about 0.6% compared to intravenous dosing.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There is no meaningful reduction in bioavailability when ibandronate is taken at least 60 minutes before a meal.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, both bioavailability and the effect on bone mineral density (BMD) are reduced when food or beverages are taken less than 60 minutes following an ibandronate dose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Distribution After absorption, ibandronate either rapidly binds to bone or is excreted into urine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In humans, the apparent terminal volume of distribution is at least 90 L, and the amount of dose removed from the circulation via the bone is estimated to be 40% to 50% of the circulating dose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In vitro protein binding in human serum was 99.5% to 90.9% over an ibandronate concentration range of 2 to 10 ng/mL in one study and approximately 85.7% over a concentration range of 0.5 to 10 ng/mL in another study.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Metabolism Ibandronate does not undergo hepatic metabolism and does not inhibit the hepatic cytochrome P450 system.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Ibandronate is eliminated by renal excretion.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Based on a rat study, the ibandronate secretory pathway does not appear to include known acidic or basic transport systems involved in the excretion of other drugs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There is no evidence that ibandronate is metabolized in humans.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Elimination The portion of ibandronate that is not removed from the circulation via bone absorption is eliminated unchanged by the kidney (approximately 50% to 60% of the absorbed dose).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Unabsorbed ibandronate is eliminated unchanged in the feces.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The plasma elimination of ibandronate is multiphasic.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Its renal clearance and distribution into bone accounts for a rapid and early decline in plasma concentrations, reaching 10% of the Cmax within 3 or 8 hours after intravenous or oral administration, respectively.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This is followed by a slower clearance phase as ibandronate redistributes back into the blood from bone.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The observed apparent terminal half-life for ibandronate is generally dependent on the dose studied and on assay sensitivity.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The observed apparent terminal half-life for the 150 mg ibandronate tablet upon oral administration to healthy postmenopausal women ranges from 37 to 157 hours.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Total clearance of ibandronate is low, with average values in the range 84 to 160 mL/min.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Renal clearance (about 60 mL/min in healthy postmenopausal females) accounts for 50% to 60% of total clearance and is related to creatinine clearance.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The difference between the apparent total and renal clearances likely reflects bone uptake of the drug.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Specific Populations Pediatrics The pharmacokinetics of ibandronate has not been studied in patients less than 18 years of age.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Geriatric Because ibandronate is not known to be metabolized, the only difference in ibandronate elimination for geriatric patients versus younger patients is expected to relate to progressive age-related changes in renal function.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Gender The bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of ibandronate are similar in both men and women.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Race Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Renal Impairment Renal clearance of ibandronate in patients with various degrees of renal impairment is linearly related to creatinine clearance (CLcr).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Following a single dose of 0.5 mg ibandronate by intravenous administration, patients with CLcr 40 to 70 mL/min had 55% higher exposure (AUC<U+221E>) than the exposure observed in subjects with CLcr greater than 90 mL/min.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients with CLcr less than 30 mL/min had more than a two-fold increase in exposure compared to the exposure for healthy subjects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hepatic Impairment No studies have been performed to assess the pharmacokinetics of ibandronate in patients with hepatic impairment because ibandronate is not metabolized in the human liver.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This degree of increase is not considered to be clinically relevant.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Propantheline is contraindicated in patients with: 1.Glaucoma, since mydriasis is to be avoided.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	2.Obstructive disease of the gastrointestinal tract (pyloroduodenal stenosis, achalasia, paralytic ileus, etc.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	5.Severe ulcerative colitis or toxic megacolon complicating ulcerative colitis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	6.Unstable cardiovascular adjustment in acute hemorrhage.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The usual initial adult dose of propantheline bromide tablets is 15 mg taken 30 minutes before each meal and 30 mg at bedtime (a total of 75 mg daily).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Subsequent dosage adjustment should be made according to the patient<U+2019>s individual response and tolerance.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Anticholinergics may delay absorption of other medication given concomitantly.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Excessive cholinergic blockade may occur if propantheline is given concomitantly with belladonna alkaloids or synthetic and semisynthetic anticholinergic agents, narcotic analgesics such as meperidine, Type 1 antiarrhythmic drugs (e.g., disopyramide, procainamide, or quinidine), antihistamines, phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, or other psychoactive drugs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Propantheline may also potentiate the sedative effect of phenothiazines.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Increased intraocular pressure may result from concurrent administration of anticholinergics and corticosteroids.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This interaction can be avoided by using only those digoxin tablets that rapidly dissolve by USP standards.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Propantheline should be used with caution in the elderly and in all patients with autonomic neuropathy, hepatic or renal disease, hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac tachyarrhythmias, hypertension, or hiatal hernia associated with reflux esophagitis, since anticholinergics may aggravate this condition.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In patients with ulcerative colitis, large doses of propantheline may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing paralytic ileus and, for this reason, may precipitate or aggravate toxic megacolon, a serious complication of the disease.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Propantheline may produce drowsiness or blurred vision.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The patient should be cautioned regarding activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or performing hazardous work, while taking this drug.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	No long-term fertility, carcinogenicity, or mutagenicity studies have been done with propantheline.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with propantheline.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is also not known whether propantheline can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Propantheline should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when propantheline is administered to a nursing woman.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Suppression of lactation may occur with anticholinergic drugs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In the presence of a high environmental temperature, heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur with the use of propantheline.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In this instance treatment with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	With overdose, a curare-like action may occur (i.e., neuromuscular blockade leading to muscular weakness and possible paralysis).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Propantheline may cause increased heart rate and therefore, should be used with caution in patients with heart disease.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Propantheline bromide inhibits gastrointestinal motility and diminishes gastric acid secretion.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The drug also inhibits the action of acetylcholine at the postganglionic nerve endings of the parasympathetic nervous system.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Propantheline bromide is extensively metabolized in man primarily by hydrolysis to the inactive materials xanthene-9-carboxylic acid and (2-hydroxyethyl) diisopropylmethylammonium bromide.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a bioavailability study, peak plasma concentrations of propantheline were achieved in about one hour, following a single oral dose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The plasma elimination half-life of propantheline is about 1.6 hours.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Approximately 70% of the dose is excreted in the urine, mostly as metabolites.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The urinary excretion of propantheline is about 3% after oral tablet administration.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Combination oral contraceptives should not be used in women with any of the following conditions: Thrombophlebitis or thromboembolic disorders A past history of deep-vein thrombophlebitis or thromboembolic disorders Cerebral-vascular or coronary-artery disease (current or history) Valvular heart disease with thrombogenic complications Thrombogenic rhythm disorders Major surgery with prolonged immobilization Diabetes with vascular involvement Headaches with focal neurological symptoms Uncontrolled hypertension Known or suspected carcinoma of the breast or personal history of breast cancer Carcinoma of the endometrium or other known or suspected estrogen-dependent neoplasia Undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding Cholestatic jaundice of pregnancy or jaundice with prior pill use Hepatic adenomas or carcinomas, or active liver disease, as long as liver function has not returned to normal Known or suspected pregnancy Hypersensitivity to any of the components of Ogestrel<U+00AE> Are receiving Hepatitis C drug combinations containing ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, due to the potential for ALT elevations.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	To achieve maximum contraceptive effectiveness, Ogestrel must be taken exactly as directed and at intervals not exceeding 24 hours.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The possibility of ovulation and conception prior to initiation of medication should be considered.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The dosage of Ogestrel is one white tablet daily for 21 consecutive days, followed by one peach inert tablet daily for 7 consecutive days, according to prescribed schedule.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is recommended that Ogestrel tablets be taken at the same time each day.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During the first cycle of medication, the patient is instructed to begin taking Ogestrel on the first Sunday after the onset of menstruation.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If menstruation begins on a Sunday, the first tablet (white) is taken that day.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	One white tablet should be taken daily for 21 consecutive days followed by one peach inert tablet daily for 7 consecutive days.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Withdrawal bleeding should usually occur within three days following discontinuation of white tablets and may not have finished before the next pack is started.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During the first cycle, contraceptive reliance should not be placed on Ogestrel until a white tablet has been taken daily for 7 consecutive days and a non-hormonal back-up method of birth control should be used during those 7 days.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The patient begins her next and all subsequent 28-day courses of tablets on the same day of the week (Sunday) on which she began her first course, following the same schedule: 21 days on white tablets<U+2014>7 days on peach inert tablets.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If in any cycle the patient starts tablets later than the proper day, she should protect herself against pregnancy by using a non-hormonal back-up method of birth control until she has taken a white tablet daily for 7 consecutive days.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When the patient is switching from a 21-day regimen of tablets, she should wait 7 days after her last tablet before she starts Ogestrel.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	She will probably experience withdrawal bleeding during that week.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	She should be sure that no more than 7 days pass after her previous 21-day regimen.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When the patient is switching from a 28-day regimen of tablets, she should start her first pack of Ogestrel on the day after her last tablet.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	She should not wait any days between packs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The patient may switch any day from a progestin-only pill and should begin Ogestrel the next day.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If switching from an implant or injection, the patient should start Ogestrel on the day of implant removal or, if using an injection, the day the next injection would be due.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In switching from a progestin-only pill, injection, or implant, the patient should be advised to use a non-hormonal back-up method of birth control for the first 7 days of tablet-taking.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If spotting or breakthrough bleeding occurs, the patient is instructed to continue on the same regimen.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This type of bleeding is usually transient and without significance; however, if the bleeding is persistent or prolonged, the patient is advised to consult her health care professional.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Although pregnancy is unlikely if Ogestrel is taken according to directions, if withdrawal bleeding does not occur, the possibility of pregnancy must be considered.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule (missed one or more tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), the probability of pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first missed period and appropriate diagnostic measures taken.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, pregnancy should be ruled out.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hormonal contraceptives should be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For additional patient instructions regarding missed tablets, see the <U+201C>WHAT TO DO IF YOU MISS PILLS<U+201D> section in the DETAILED PATIENT LABELING below.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Any time the patient misses two or more white tablets, she should also use another method of contraception until she has taken a white tablet daily for seven consecutive days.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If the patient misses one or more peach tablets, she is still protected against pregnancy provided she begins taking white tablets again on the proper day.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If breakthrough bleeding occurs following missed white tablets, it will usually be transient and of no consequence.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The possibility of ovulation increases with each successive day that scheduled white tablets are missed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Ogestrel may be initiated no earlier than day 28 postpartum in the non-lactating mother due to the increased risk for thromboembolism.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The patient should be advised to use a non-hormonal back-up method for the first 7 days of tablet-taking.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, if intercourse has already occurred, the possibility of ovulation and conception prior to initiation of medication should be considered.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In the case of first-trimester abortion, if the patient starts Ogestrel immediately, additional contraceptive measures are not needed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	General Patients should be counseled that oral contraceptives do not protect against transmission of HIV (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) such as chlamydia, genital herpes, genital warts, gonorrhea, hepatitis B, and syphilis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Physical Examination and Follow-Up A periodic personal and family medical history and complete physical examination are appropriate for all women, including women using oral contraceptives.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The physical examination, however, may be deferred until after initiation of oral contraceptives if requested by the woman and judged appropriate by the clinician.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The physical examination should include special reference to blood pressure, breasts, abdomen and pelvic organs, including cervical cytology, and relevant laboratory tests.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In case of undiagnosed, persistent or recurrent abnormal vaginal bleeding, appropriate diagnostic measures should be conducted to rule out malignancy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	They should be prescribed with caution, and only with careful monitoring, in patients with conditions which might be aggravated by fluid retention.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Emotional Disorders Patients becoming significantly depressed while taking oral contraceptives should stop the medication and use an alternate method of contraception in an attempt to determine whether the symptom is drug related.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and the drug discontinued if significant depression occurs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Contact Lenses Contact-lens wearers who develop visual changes or changes in lens tolerance should be assessed by an ophthalmologist.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Gastrointestinal Motility Diarrhea and/or vomiting may reduce hormone absorption.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drug Interactions Changes in contraceptive effectiveness associated with coadministration of other products: Contraceptive effectiveness may be reduced when hormonal contraceptives are coadministered with antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and other drugs that increase the metabolism of contraceptive steroids.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This could result in unintended pregnancy or breakthrough bleeding.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Examples include rifampin, barbiturates, phenylbutazone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, and griseofulvin.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Several cases of contraceptive failure and breakthrough bleeding have been reported in the literature with concomitant administration of antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracyclines.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, clinical pharmacology studies investigating drug interactions between combined oral contraceptives and these antibiotics have reported inconsistent results.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Several of the anti-HIV protease inhibitors have been studied with coadministration of oral combination hormonal contraceptives; significant changes (increase and decrease) in the plasma levels of the estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The safety and efficacy of oral contraceptive products may be affected with coadministration of anti-HIV protease inhibitors.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Health care professionals should refer to the label of the individual anti-HIV protease inhibitors for further drug-drug interaction information.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Herbal products containing St. John<U+2019>s Wort (Hypericum perforatum) may induce hepatic enzymes (cytochrome P 450) and p-glycoprotein transporter and may reduce the effectiveness of contraceptive steroids.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This may also result in breakthrough bleeding.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Changes in plasma levels of coadministered drugs: Combination hormonal contraceptives containing some synthetic estrogens (e.g., ethinyl estradiol) may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Troleandomycin may increase the risk of intrahepatic cholestasis during coadministration with combination oral contraceptives.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The prescribing information of concomitant medications should be consulted to identify potential interactions.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant Use with HCV Combination Therapy <U+2013> Liver Enzyme Elevation Do not co-administer Ogestrel with HCV drug combinations containing ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, due to potential for ALT elevations.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Interactions with Laboratory Tests Certain endocrine- and liver-function tests and blood components may be affected by oral contraceptives: Increased prothrombin and factors VII, VIII, IX, and X; decreased antithrombin 3; increased norepinephrine-induced platelet aggregability.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone, as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4 by column or by radioimmunoassay.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Sex-hormone-binding globulins are increased and result in elevated levels of total circulating sex steroids and corticoids; however, free or biologically active levels remain unchanged.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Triglycerides may be increased and levels of various other lipids and lipoproteins may be affected.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Serum folate levels may be depressed by oral contraceptive therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS sections.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Nursing Mothers Small amounts of oral contraceptive steroids and/or metabolites have been identified in the milk of nursing mothers, and a few adverse effects on the child have been reported, including jaundice and breast enlargement.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In addition, combination oral contraceptives given in the postpartum period may interfere with lactation by decreasing the quantity and quality of breast milk.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If possible, the nursing mother should be advised not to use combination oral contraceptives but to use other forms of contraception until she has completely weaned her child.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy of Ogestrel tablets have been established in women of reproductive age.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Geriatric Use This product has not been studied in women over 65 years of age and is not indicated in this population.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular side effects from oral contraceptive use.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This risk increases with age and with the extent of smoking (in epidemiologic studies, 15 or more cigarettes per day was associated with a significantly increased risk) and is quite marked in women over 35 years of age.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Women who use oral contraceptives should be strongly advised not to smoke.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The use of oral contraceptives is associated with increased risks of several serious conditions including venous and arterial thrombotic and thromboembolic events (such as myocardial infarction, thromboembolism, and stroke), hepatic neoplasia, gallbladder disease, and hypertension, although the risk of serious morbidity or mortality is very small in healthy women without underlying risk factors.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The risk of morbidity and mortality increases significantly in the presence of other underlying risk factors such as certain inherited or acquired thrombophilias, hypertension, hyperlipidemias, obesity and diabetes.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Practitioners prescribing oral contraceptives should be familiar with the following information relating to these risks.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The information contained in this package insert is based principally on studies carried out in patients who used oral contraceptives with higher formulations of estrogens and progestogens than those in common use today.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effect of long-term use of the oral contraceptives with lower formulations of both estrogens and progestogens remains to be determined.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Throughout this labeling, epidemiological studies reported are of two types: retrospective or case control studies and prospective or cohort studies.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Case control studies provide a measure of the relative risk of disease, namely, a ratio of the incidence of a disease among oral contraceptive users to that among non-users.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The relative risk does not provide information on the actual clinical occurrence of a disease.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cohort studies provide a measure of attributable risk, which is the difference in the incidence of disease between oral contraceptive users and non-users.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The attributable risk does provide information about the actual occurrence of a disease in the population.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For further information, the reader is referred to a text on epidemiological methods.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems a. Myocardial infarction An increased risk of myocardial infarction has been attributed to oral contraceptive use.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This risk is primarily in smokers or women with other underlying risk factors for coronary-artery disease such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, morbid obesity, and diabetes.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The relative risk of heart attack for current oral contraceptive users has been estimated to be 2 to 6.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The risk is very low under the age of 30.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Smoking in combination with oral contraceptive use has been shown to contribute substantially to the incidence of myocardial infarction in women in their mid-thirties or older with smoking accounting for the majority of excess cases.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Mortality rates associated with circulatory disease have been shown to increase substantially in smokers over the age of 35 and non-smokers over the age of 40 (Table II) among women who use oral contraceptives.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CIRCULATORY DISEASE MORTALITY RATES PER 100,000 WOMAN YEARS BY AGE, SMOKING STATUS AND ORAL CONTRACEPTIVE USE TABLE II: (Adapted From P.M. Layde And V. Beral, Lancet, 1:541-546, 1981.)	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Oral contraceptives may compound the effects of well-known risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemias, age, and obesity.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In particular, some progestogens are known to decrease HDL cholesterol and cause glucose intolerance, while estrogens may create a state of hyperinsulinism.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Oral contraceptives have been shown to increase blood pressure among users.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Similar effects on risk factors have been associated with an increased risk of heart disease.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. b. Thromboembolism An increased risk of venous thromboembolic and thrombotic disease associated with the use of oral contraceptives is well established.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Case control studies have found the relative risk of users compared to non-users to be 3 for the first episode of superficial venous thrombosis, 4 to 11 for deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, and 1.5 to 6 for women with predisposing conditions for venous thromboembolic disease.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cohort studies have shown the relative risk to be somewhat lower, about 3 for new cases and about 4.5 for new cases requiring hospitalization.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The approximate incidence of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in users of low dose (<50 mcg ethinyl estradiol) combination oral contraceptives is up to 4 per 10,000 woman-years compared to 0.5-3 per 10,000 woman-years for non-users.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, the incidence is less than that associated with pregnancy (6 per 10,000 woman-years).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The risk of thromboembolic disease due to oral contraceptives is not related to length of use and disappears after pill use is stopped.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A 2- to 4-fold increase in relative risk of postoperative thromboembolic complications has been reported with the use of oral contraceptives.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The relative risk of venous thrombosis in women who have predisposing conditions is twice that of women without such medical conditions.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If feasible, oral contraceptives should be discontinued at least 4 weeks prior to and for 2 weeks after elective surgery of a type associated with an increase in risk of thromboembolism and during and following prolonged immobilization.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Since the immediate postpartum period is also associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, oral contraceptives should be started no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery in women who elect not to breastfeed. c. Cerebrovascular diseases Oral contraceptives have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (>35 years), hypertensive women who also smoke.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hypertension was found to be a risk factor for both users and non-users for both types of strokes, while smoking interacted to increase the risk for hemorrhagic strokes.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a large study, the relative risk of thrombotic strokes has been shown to range from 3 for normotensive users to 14 for users with severe hypertension.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The relative risk of hemorrhagic stroke is reported to be 1.2 for non-smokers who used oral contraceptives, 2.6 for smokers who did not use oral contraceptives, 7.6 for smokers who used oral contraceptives, 1.8 for normotensive users, and 25.7 for users with severe hypertension.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The attributable risk is also greater in older women.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Oral contraceptives also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors such as certain inherited or acquired thrombophilias, hyperlipidemias, and obesity.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Women with migraine (particularly migraine with aura) who take combination oral contraceptives may be at an increased risk of stroke. d. Dose-related risk of vascular disease from oral contraceptives A positive association has been observed between the amount of estrogen and progestogen in oral contraceptives and the risk of vascular disease.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A decline in serum high-density lipoproteins (HDL) has been reported with many progestational agents.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A decline in serum high-density lipoproteins has been associated with an increased incidence of ischemic heart disease.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because estrogens increase HDL cholesterol, the net effect of an oral contraceptive depends on a balance achieved between doses of estrogen and progestogen and the nature and absolute amount of progestogen used in the contraceptive.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The amount of both hormones should be considered in the choice of an oral contraceptive.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Minimizing exposure to estrogen and progestogen is in keeping with good principles of therapeutics.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For any particular estrogen/progestogen combination, the dosage regimen prescribed should be one which contains the least amount of estrogen and progestogen that is compatible with a low failure rate and the needs of the individual patient.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	New acceptors of oral contraceptive agents should be started on preparations containing the lowest estrogen content which is judged appropriate for the individual patient. e. Persistence of risk of vascular disease There are two studies which have shown persistence of risk of vascular disease for ever-users of oral contraceptives.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a study in the United States, the risk of developing myocardial infarction after discontinuing oral contraceptives persists for at least 9 years for women 40<U+2013>49 years who had used oral contraceptives for 5 or more years, but this increased risk was not demonstrated in other age groups.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In another study in Great Britain, the risk of developing cerebrovascular disease persisted for at least 6 years after discontinuation of oral contraceptives, although excess risk was very small.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, both studies were performed with oral contraceptive formulations containing 50 mcg or higher of estrogen.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Estimates of Mortality from Contraceptive Use One study gathered data from a variety of sources which have estimated the mortality rate associated with different methods of contraception at different ages (Table III).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These estimates include the combined risk of death associated with contraceptive methods plus the risk attributable to pregnancy in the event of method failure.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Each method of contraception has its specific benefits and risks.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The study concluded that with the exception of oral contraceptive users 35 and older who smoke and 40 and older who do not smoke, mortality associated with all methods of birth control is less than that associated with childbirth.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The observation of a possible increase in risk of mortality with age for oral contraceptive users is based on data gathered in the 1970<U+2019>s<U+2014>but not reported until 1983.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, current clinical practice involves the use of lower estrogen dose formulations combined with careful restriction of oral contraceptive use to women who do not have the various risk factors listed in this labeling.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because of these changes in practice and, also, because of some limited new data which suggest that the risk of cardiovascular disease with the use of oral contraceptives may now be less than previously observed, the Fertility and Maternal Health Drugs Advisory Committee was asked to review the topic in 1989.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The Committee concluded that although cardiovascular-disease risks may be increased with oral contraceptive use after age 40 in healthy non-smoking women (even with the newer low-dose formulations), there are greater potential health risks associated with pregnancy in older women and with the alternative surgical and medical procedures which may be necessary if such women do not have access to effective and acceptable means of contraception.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the Committee recommended that the benefits of oral contraceptive use by healthy non-smoking women over 40 may outweigh the possible risks.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Of course, older women, as all women who take oral contraceptives, should take the lowest possible dose formulation that is effective.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Carcinoma of the Reproductive Organs and Breasts Numerous epidemiological studies have been performed on the incidence of breast, endometrial, ovarian and cervical cancer in women using oral contraceptives.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Although the risk of having breast cancer diagnosed may be slightly increased among current and recent users of combined oral contraceptives (RR=1.24), this excess risk decreases over time after combination oral contraceptive discontinuation and by 10 years after cessation the increased risk disappears.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The risk does not increase with duration of use and no consistent relationships have been found with dose or type of steroid.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The patterns of risk are also similar regardless of a woman<U+2019>s reproductive history or her family breast cancer history.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The subgroup for whom risk has been found to be significantly elevated is women who first used oral contraceptives before age 20, but because breast cancer is so rare at these young ages, the number of cases attributable to this early oral contraceptive use is extremely small.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Breast cancers diagnosed in current or previous oral contraceptive users tend to be less clinically advanced than in never-users.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use oral contraceptives because breast cancer is a hormone sensitive tumor.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Some studies suggest that oral contraceptive use has been associated with an increase in the risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or invasive cervical cancer in some populations of women.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, there continues to be controversy about the extent to which such findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In spite of many studies of the relationship between oral contraceptive use and breast and cervical cancers, a cause-and-effect relationship has not been established.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hepatic Neoplasia Benign hepatic adenomas are associated with oral contraceptive use, although the incidence of benign tumors is rare in the United States.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Indirect calculations have estimated the attributable risk to be in the range of 3.3 cases/100,000 for users, a risk that increases after 4 or more years of use.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rupture of rare, benign, hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Studies from Britain have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (>8 years) oral contraceptive users.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, these cancers are extremely rare in the U.S., and the attributable risk (the excess incidence) of liver cancers in oral contraceptive users approaches less than one per million users.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Risk of Liver Enzyme Elevations with Concomitant Hepatitis C Treatment During clinical trials with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen that contains ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, ALT elevations greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), including some cases greater than 20 times the ULN, were significantly more frequent in women using ethinyl estradiol-containing medications such as COCs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Discontinue Ogestrel prior to starting therapy with the combination drug regimen ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Ogestrel can be restarted approximately 2 weeks following completion of treatment with the combination drug regimen.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Ocular Lesions There have been clinical case reports of retinal thrombosis associated with the use of oral contraceptives that may lead to partial or complete loss of vision.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Oral contraceptives should be discontinued if there is unexplained partial or complete loss of vision; onset of proptosis or diplopia; papilledema; or retinal vascular lesions.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic measures should be undertaken immediately.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Oral Contraceptive Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in infants born to women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly insofar as cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects are concerned, when taken inadvertently during early pregnancy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Oral contraceptives should not be used during pregnancy to treat threatened or habitual abortion.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is recommended that for any patient who has missed 2 consecutive periods, pregnancy should be ruled out.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule, the possibility of pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first missed period.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Oral contraceptive use should be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Gallbladder Disease Earlier studies have reported an increased lifetime relative risk of gallbladder surgery in users of oral contraceptives and estrogens.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	More recent studies, however, have shown that the relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among oral contraceptive users may be minimal.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The recent findings of minimal risk may be related to the use of oral contraceptive formulations containing lower hormonal doses of estrogens and progestogens.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Oral contraceptives have been shown to cause glucose intolerance in a significant percentage of users.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Oral contraceptives containing greater than 75 mcg of estrogens cause hyperinsulinism, while lower doses of estrogen cause less glucose intolerance.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Progestogens increase insulin secretion and create insulin resistance, this effect varying with different progestational agents.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, in the non-diabetic woman, oral contraceptives appear to have no effect on fasting blood glucose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because of these demonstrated effects, prediabetic and diabetic women should be carefully observed while taking oral contraceptives.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A small proportion of women will have persistent hypertriglyceridemia while on the pill.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	As discussed earlier, changes in serum triglycerides and lipoprotein levels have been reported in oral contraceptive users.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Elevated Blood Pressure Women with significant hypertension should not be started on hormonal contraception.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking oral contraceptives, and this increase is more likely in older oral contraceptive users and with continued use.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Data from the Royal College of General Practitioners and subsequent randomized trials have shown that the incidence of hypertension increases with increasing quantities of progestogens.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Women with a history of hypertension or hypertension-related diseases, or renal disease, should be encouraged to use another method of contraception.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If women with hypertension elect to use oral contraceptives, they should be monitored closely, and if significant elevation of blood pressure occurs, oral contraceptives should be discontinued.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For most women, elevated blood pressure will return to normal after stopping oral contraceptives, and there is no difference in the occurrence of hypertension among ever- and never-users.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Headache The onset or exacerbation of migraine or development of headache with a new pattern that is recurrent, persistent, or severe requires discontinuation of oral contraceptives and evaluation of the cause.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Bleeding Irregularities Breakthrough bleeding and spotting are sometimes encountered in patients on oral contraceptives, especially during the first 3 months of use.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The type and dose of progestogen may be important.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If bleeding persists or recurs, non-hormonal causes should be considered and adequate diagnostic measures taken to rule out malignancy or pregnancy in the event of breakthrough bleeding, as in the case of any abnormal vaginal bleeding.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If pathology has been excluded, time or a change to another formulation may solve the problem.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In the event of amenorrhea, pregnancy should be ruled out.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea (possibly with anovulation), especially when such a condition was pre-existent.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Ectopic Pregnancy Ectopic as well as intrauterine pregnancy may occur in contraceptive failures.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Mode of Action Combination oral contraceptives act by suppression of gonadotropins.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Although the primary mechanism of this action is inhibition of ovulation, other alterations include changes in the cervical mucus (which increase the difficulty of sperm entry into the uterus) and the endometrium (which reduce the likelihood of implantation).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	DEXILANT is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis have been reported.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) has been reported with other proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), including lansoprazole of which dexlansoprazole is the R-enantiomer.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	PPIs, including DEXILANT, are contraindicated with rilpivirine-containing products.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients with known hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients receiving rilpivirine-containing products.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	For patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B), the recommended dosage is 30 mg DEXILANT once daily for up to eight weeks.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	DEXILANT is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Missed doses: If a dose is missed, administer as soon as possible.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, if the next scheduled dose is due, do not take the missed dose, and take the next dose on time.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Do not take two doses at one time to make up for a missed dose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For patients who have trouble swallowing capsules, DEXILANT capsules can be opened and administered with applesauce as follows: Place one tablespoonful of applesauce into a clean container.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Swallow applesauce and granules immediately.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Do not save the applesauce and granules for later use.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Alternatively, the capsule can be administered with water via oral syringe or nasogastric (NG) tube.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Administration with Water in an Oral Syringe Open the capsule and empty the granules into a clean container with 20 mL of water.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Withdraw the entire mixture into a syringe.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Gently swirl the syringe in order to keep granules from settling.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Administer the mixture immediately into the mouth.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Refill the syringe again with 10 mL of water, swirl gently, and administer.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Administration with Water via a NG Tube (<U+2265>16 French) Open the capsule and empty the granules into a clean container with 20 mL of water.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Withdraw the entire mixture into a catheter-tip syringe.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Swirl the catheter-tip syringe gently in order to keep the granules from settling, and immediately inject the mixture through the NG tube into the stomach.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Refill the catheter-tip syringe with 10 mL of water, swirl gently, and flush the tube.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Refill the catheter-tip syringe again with 10 mL of water, swirl gently, and administer.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Tables 3 and 4 include drugs with clinically important drug interactions and interaction with diagnostics when administered concomitantly with DEXILANT and instructions for preventing or managing them.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Consult the labeling of concomitantly used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with PPIs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Clinically Relevant Interactions Affecting Drugs Co-Administered with DEXILANT and Interactions with Diagnostics Antiretrovirals Clinical Impact: The effect of PPIs on antiretroviral drugs is variable.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The clinical importance and the mechanisms behind these interactions are not always known.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Decreased exposure of some antiretroviral drugs (e.g., rilpivirine, atazanavir, and nelfinavir) when used concomitantly with dexlansoprazole may reduce antiviral effect and promote the development of drug resistance.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There are other antiretroviral drugs which do not result in clinically relevant interactions with dexlansoprazole.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Intervention: Rilpivirine-containing products: Concomitant use with DEXILANT is contraindicated.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Atazanavir: See prescribing information for atazanavir for dosing information.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Intervention: Monitor tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dose adjustment of tacrolimus may be needed to maintain therapeutic drug concentrations.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	See prescribing information for tacrolimus.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Interactions with Investigations of Neuroendocrine Tumors Clinical Impact: CgA levels increase secondary to PPI-induced decreases in gastric acidity.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The increased CgA level may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Intervention: Temporarily stop DEXILANT treatment at least 14 days before assessing CgA levels and consider repeating the test if initial CgA levels are high.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If serial tests are performed (e.g., for monitoring), the same commercial laboratory should be used for testing, as reference ranges between tests may vary.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Interaction with Secretin Stimulation Test Clinical Impact: Hyper-response in gastrin secretion in response to secretin stimulation test, falsely suggesting gastrinoma.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Intervention: Temporarily stop DEXILANT treatment at least 30 days before assessing to allow gastrin levels to return to baseline.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	False Positive Urine Tests for THC Clinical Impact: There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving PPIs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Hypomagnesemia: Reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Interactions with Investigations for Neuroendocrine Tumors: Increases in intragastric pH may result in hypergastrinemia and enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia and increased chromogranin A levels which may interfere with diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	With high-dose methotrexate administration, consider a temporary withdrawal of DEXILANT.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Fundic Gland Polyps: Risk increases with long-term use, especially beyond 1 year.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In adults, symptomatic response to therapy with DEXILANT does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Consider additional follow-up and diagnostic testing in adult patients who have a suboptimal response or an early symptomatic relapse after completing treatment with a PPI.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In older patients, also consider an endoscopy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs including lansoprazole.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Acute interstitial nephritis may occur at any point during PPI therapy and is generally attributed to an idiopathic hypersensitivity reaction.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Discontinue DEXILANT if acute interstitial nephritis develops.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like DEXILANT may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Several published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the conditions being treated.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	The most common form of CLE reported in patients treated with PPIs was subacute CLE (SCLE) and occurred within weeks to years after continuous drug therapy in patients ranging from infants to the elderly.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Generally, histological findings were observed without organ involvement.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is less commonly reported than CLE in patients receiving PPIs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	PPI-associated SLE is usually milder than non-drug induced SLE.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Onset of SLE typically occurred within days to years after initiating treatment primarily in patients ranging from young adults to the elderly.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The majority of patients presented with rash; however, arthralgia and cytopenia were also reported.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Avoid administration of PPIs for longer than medically indicated.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If signs or symptoms consistent with CLE or SLE are noted in patients receiving DEXILANT, discontinue the drug and refer the patient to the appropriate specialist for evaluation.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Most patients improve with discontinuation of the PPI alone in four to 12 weeks.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Serological testing (e.g., ANA) may be positive and elevated serological test results may take longer to resolve than clinical manifestations.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), healthcare professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Serum chromogranin A (CgA) levels increase secondary to drug-induced decreases in gastric acidity.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Healthcare providers should temporarily stop dexlansoprazole treatment at least 14 days before assessing CgA levels and consider repeating the test if initial CgA levels are high.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	PPI use is associated with an increased risk of fundic gland polyps that increases with long-term use, especially beyond one year.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Most PPI users who developed fundic gland polyps were asymptomatic and fundic gland polyps were identified incidentally on endoscopy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Use the shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dexlansoprazole belongs to a class of antisecretory compounds, the substituted benzimidazoles, that suppress gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the (H+, K+)-ATPase at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because this enzyme is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the parietal cell, dexlansoprazole has been characterized as a gastric proton-pump inhibitor, in that it blocks the final step of acid production.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Antisecretory Activity The effects of DEXILANT 60 mg (n=20) or lansoprazole 30 mg (n=23) once daily for five days on 24 hour intragastric pH were assessed in healthy subjects in a multiple-dose crossover study.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The mean fasting gastrin concentrations increased from baseline during treatment with 30 and 60 mg DEXILANT.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In patients treated for more than six months, mean serum gastrin levels increased during approximately the first three months of treatment and were stable for the remainder of treatment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Mean serum gastrin levels returned to pre-treatment levels within one month of discontinuation of treatment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Increased gastrin causes enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia and increased serum CgA levels.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The increased CgA levels may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Enterochromaffin-Like Cell (ECL) Effects There were no reports of ECL cell hyperplasia in gastric biopsy specimens obtained from 653 patients treated with DEXILANT 30, 60, or 90 mg for up to 12 months.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During lifetime exposure of rats dosed daily with up to 150 mg/kg/day of lansoprazole, marked hypergastrinemia was observed followed by ECL cell proliferation and formation of carcinoid tumors, especially in female rats.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cardiac Electrophysiology At a dose five times the maximum recommended dose, dexlansoprazole does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The dual delayed-release formulation of DEXILANT results in a dexlansoprazole plasma concentration-time profile with two distinct peaks; the first peak occurs one to two hours after administration, followed by a second peak within four to five hours.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dexlansoprazole is eliminated with a half-life of approximately one to two hours in healthy subjects and in patients with symptomatic GERD.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	No accumulation of dexlansoprazole occurs after multiple, once daily doses of DEXILANT 30 or 60 mg although mean AUCt and Cmax values of dexlansoprazole were slightly higher (less than 10%) on Day 5 than on Day 1.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Figure 1: Mean Plasma Dexlansoprazole Concentration <U+2013> Time Profile Following Oral Administration of 30 or 60 mg DEXILANT Once Daily for 5 Days in Healthy Adult Subjects The pharmacokinetics of dexlansoprazole are highly variable, with percent coefficient of variation (%CV) values for Cmax, AUC, and CL/F of greater than 30%.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Mean (%CV) Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Adult Subjects on Day 5 After Administration of DEXILANT Dose(mg) Cmax (ng/mL) AUC24 (ng<U+2219>h/mL) CL/F(L/h) 30 658 (40%)(N=44) 3275 (47%)(N=43) 11.4 (48%)(N=43) 60 1397 (51%)(N=79) 6529 (60%)(N=73) 11.6 (46%)(N=41) Absorption After oral administration of DEXILANT 30 or 60 mg to healthy subjects and symptomatic GERD patients, mean Cmax and AUC values of dexlansoprazole increased approximately dose proportionally.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When granules of DEXILANT 60 mg are mixed with water and dosed via NG tube or orally via syringe, the bioavailability (Cmax and AUC) of dexlansoprazole was similar to that when DEXILANT 60 mg was administered as an intact capsule.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Distribution Plasma protein binding of dexlansoprazole ranged from 96 to 99% in healthy subjects and was independent of concentration from 0.01 to 20 mcg/mL.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) after multiple doses in symptomatic GERD patients was 40 L. Elimination Metabolism Dexlansoprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by oxidation, reduction, and subsequent formation of sulfate, glucuronide and glutathione conjugates to inactive metabolites.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Oxidative metabolites are formed by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system including hydroxylation mainly by CYP2C19, and oxidation to the sulfone by CYP3A4.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CYP2C19 is a polymorphic liver enzyme which exhibits three phenotypes in the metabolism of CYP2C19 substrates: extensive metabolizers (*1/*1), intermediate metabolizers (*1/mutant) and poor metabolizers (mutant/mutant).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dexlansoprazole is the major circulating component in plasma regardless of CYP2C19 metabolizer status.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In CYP2C19 intermediate and extensive metabolizers, the major plasma metabolites are 5-hydroxy dexlansoprazole and its glucuronide conjugate, while in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers dexlansoprazole sulfone is the major plasma metabolite.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Excretion Following the administration of DEXILANT, no unchanged dexlansoprazole is excreted in urine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Following the administration of [14C] dexlansoprazole to six healthy male subjects, approximately 50.7% (standard deviation (SD): 9.0%) of the administered radioactivity was excreted in urine and 47.6% (SD: 7.3%) in the feces.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Apparent clearance (CL/F) in healthy subjects was 11.4 to 11.6 L/hour, respectively, after five days of 30 or 60 mg once daily administration.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Specific Populations Age: Pediatric Population The pharmacokinetics of dexlansoprazole in patients under the age of 12 years have not been studied.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients 12 to 17 Years of Age The pharmacokinetics of dexlansoprazole were studied in 36 patients 12 to 17 years of age with symptomatic GERD in a multi-center trial.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients were randomized to receive DEXILANT 30 or 60 mg once daily for seven days.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The dexlansoprazole mean Cmax and AUC in patients 12 to 17 years of age were 105 and 88%, respectively, compared to those observed in adults at the 30 mg dose, and were 81 and 78%, respectively, at the 60 mg dose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Mean (%CV) Pharmacokinetic Parameters in Patients 12 to 17 Years of Age with Symptomatic GERD on Day 7 After Administration of DEXILANT Once Daily for 7 Days Dose Cmax (ng/mL) AUCtau (ng<U+2219>h/mL) CL/F(L/h) 30 mg(N=17) 691(53) 2886(47) 12.8(48) 60 mg(N=18) 1136(51) 5120(58) 15.3(49) Age: Geriatric Population The terminal elimination half-life of dexlansoprazole is significantly increased in geriatric subjects compared to younger subjects (2.2 and 1.5 hours, respectively).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dexlansoprazole exhibited higher systemic exposure (AUC) in geriatric subjects (34% higher) than younger subjects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Sex In a study of 12 male and 12 female healthy subjects who received a single dose of DEXILANT 60 mg, females had higher systemic exposure (AUC) (43% higher) than males.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This difference in exposure between males and female does not represent a significant safety concern.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Renal Impairment Dexlansoprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver to inactive metabolites, and no parent drug is recovered in the urine following an oral dose of dexlansoprazole.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the pharmacokinetics of dexlansoprazole are not expected to be altered in patients with renal impairment, and no studies were conducted in patients with renal impairment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In addition, the pharmacokinetics of lansoprazole were not clinically different in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment compared to healthy subjects with normal renal function.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hepatic Impairment In a study of 12 patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) who received a single dose of 60 mg DEXILANT, the systemic exposure (AUC) of bound and unbound dexlansoprazole was approximately two times greater compared to subjects with normal hepatic function.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This difference in exposure was not due to a difference in protein binding.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drug-Drug Interactions Effect of Dexlansoprazole on Other Drugs Cytochrome P 450 Interactions Dexlansoprazole is metabolized, in part, by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In vitro studies have shown that dexlansoprazole is not likely to inhibit CYP isoforms 1A1, 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 or 3A4.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	As such, no clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Furthermore, in vivo studies showed that DEXILANT did not have an impact on the pharmacokinetics of co-administered phenytoin (CYP2C9 substrate) or theophylline (CYP1A2 substrate).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The subjects' CYP1A2 genotypes in the drug-drug interaction study with theophylline were not determined.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Although in vitro studies indicated that DEXILANT has the potential to inhibit CYP2C19 in vivo, an in vivo drug-drug interaction study in mainly CYP2C19 extensive and intermediate metabolizers has shown that DEXILANT does not affect the pharmacokinetics of diazepam (CYP2C19 substrate).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Clopidogrel Clopidogrel is metabolized to its active metabolite in part by CYP2C19.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A study of healthy subjects who were CYP2C19 extensive metabolizers, receiving once daily administration of clopidogrel 75 mg alone or concomitantly with DEXILANT 60 mg (n=40), for nine days was conducted.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Pharmacodynamic parameters were also measured and demonstrated that the change in inhibition of platelet aggregation (induced by 5 mcM ADP) was related to the change in the exposure to clopidogrel active metabolite.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effect on exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel and on clopidogrel-induced platelet inhibition is not considered clinically important.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effect of Other Drugs on Dexlansoprazole Because dexlansoprazole is metabolized by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, inducers and inhibitors of these enzymes may potentially alter exposure of dexlansoprazole.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Figure 1 Effect of CYP2C19 Polymorphism on Systemic Exposure of Dexlansoprazole Systemic exposure of dexlansoprazole is generally higher in intermediate and poor metabolizers.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In male Japanese subjects who received a single dose of DEXILANT 30 or 60 mg (N=2 to 6 subjects/group), mean dexlansoprazole Cmax and AUC values were up to two times higher in intermediate compared to extensive metabolizers; in poor metabolizers, mean Cmax was up to four times higher and mean AUC was up to 12 times higher compared to extensive metabolizers.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Though such study was not conducted in Caucasians and African Americans, it is expected dexlansoprazole exposure in these races will be affected by CYP2C19 phenotypes as well.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	All diuretics, including ethacrynic acid, are contraindicated in anuria.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If increasing electrolyte imbalance, azotemia, and/or oliguria occur during treatment of severe, progressive renal disease, the diuretic should be discontinued.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a few patients this diuretic has produced severe, watery diarrhea.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If this occurs, it should be discontinued and not used again.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Until further experience in infants is accumulated, therapy with oral and parenteral EDECRIN is contraindicated.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hypersensitivity to any component of this product.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dosage must be regulated carefully to prevent a more rapid or substantial loss of fluid or electrolyte than is indicated or necessary.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The magnitude of diuresis and natriuresis is largely dependent on the degree of fluid accumulation present in the patient.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Similarly, the extent of potassium excretion is determined in large measure by the presence and magnitude of aldosteronism.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	EDECRIN is available for oral use as 25 mg tablets.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In Adults: The smallest dose required to produce gradual weight loss (about 1 to 2 pounds per day) is recommended.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Onset of diuresis usually occurs at 50 to 100 mg for adults.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	After diuresis has been achieved, the minimally effective dose (usually from 50 to 200 mg daily) may be given on a continuous or intermittent dosage schedule.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dosage adjustments are usually in 25 to 50 mg increments to avoid derangement of water and electrolyte excretion.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The patient should be weighed under standard conditions before and during the institution of diuretic therapy with this compound.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The following schedule may be helpful in determining the smallest effective dose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Day 1 <U+2014> 50 mg once daily after a meal Day 2 <U+2014> 50 mg twice daily after meals, if necessary Day 3 <U+2014> 100 mg in the morning and 50 to 100 mg following the afternoon or evening meal, depending upon response to the morning dose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A few patients may require initial and maintenance doses as high as 200 mg twice daily.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These higher doses, which should be achieved gradually, are most often required in patients with severe, refractory edema.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In Pediatric Patients (excluding infants, see CONTRAINDICATIONS): The initial dose should be 25 mg.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Careful stepwise increments in dosage of 25 mg should be made to achieve effective maintenance.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is usually possible to reduce the dosage and frequency of administration once dry weight has been achieved.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	EDECRIN (Ethacrynic Acid) may be given intermittently after an effective diuresis is obtained with the regimen outlined above.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dosage may be on an alternate daily schedule or more prolonged periods of diuretic therapy may be interspersed with rest periods.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Such an intermittent dosage schedule allows time for correction of any electrolyte imbalance and may provide a more efficient diuretic response.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The chloruretic effect of this agent may give rise to retention of bicarbonate and a metabolic alkalosis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This may be corrected by giving chloride (ammonium chloride or arginine chloride).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Ammonium chloride should not be given to cirrhotic patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	EDECRIN has additive effects when used with other diuretics.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For example, a patient who is on maintenance dosage of an oral diuretic may require additional intermittent diuretic therapy, such as an organomercurial, for the maintenance of basal weight.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The intermittent use of EDECRIN orally may eliminate the need for injections of organomercurials.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Small doses of EDECRIN may be added to existing diuretic regimens to maintain basal weight.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This drug may potentiate the action of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, with augmentation of natriuresis and kaliuresis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, when adding EDECRIN the initial dose and changes of dose should be in 25 mg increments, to avoid electrolyte depletion.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rarely, patients who failed to respond to ethacrynic acid have responded to older established agents.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	While many patients do not require supplemental potassium, the use of potassium chloride or potassium-sparing agents, or both, during treatment with EDECRIN is advisable, especially in cirrhotic or nephrotic patients and in patients receiving digitalis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Salt liberalization usually prevents the development of hyponatremia and hypochloremia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During treatment with EDECRIN, salt may be liberalized to a greater extent than with other diuretics.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cirrhotic patients, however, usually require at least moderate salt restriction concomitant with diuretic therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Intravenous SODIUM EDECRIN is for intravenous use when oral intake is impractical or in urgent conditions, such as acute pulmonary edema.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The usual intravenous dose for the average sized adult is 50 mg, or 0.5 to 1.0 mg per kg of body weight.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Usually only one dose has been necessary; occasionally a second dose at a new injection site, to avoid possible thrombophlebitis, may be required.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A single intravenous dose not exceeding 100 mg has been used in critical situations.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Insufficient pediatric experience precludes recommendation for this age group.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	To reconstitute the dry material, add 50 mL of 5 percent Dextrose Injection, or Sodium Chloride Injection to the vial.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Occasionally, some 5 percent Dextrose Injection solutions may have a low pH (below 5).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The resulting solution with such a diluent may be hazy or opalescent.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Intravenous use of such a solution is not recommended.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Inspect the vial containing Intravenous SODIUM EDECRIN for particulate matter and discoloration before use.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The solution may be given slowly through the tubing of a running infusion or by direct intravenous injection over a period of several minutes.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Do not mix this solution with whole blood or its derivatives.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Discard unused reconstituted solution after 24 hours.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	SODIUM EDECRIN should not be given subcutaneously or intramuscularly because of local pain and irritation.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Read circulars for lithium preparations before use of such concomitant therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	EDECRIN may increase the ototoxic potential of other drugs such as aminoglycoside and some cephalosporin antibiotics.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In some patients, the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing and thiazide diuretics.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, when EDECRIN and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Weakness, muscle cramps, paresthesias, thirst, anorexia, and signs of hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and/or hypochloremic alkalosis may occur following vigorous or excessive diuresis and these may be accentuated by rigid salt restriction.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rarely, tetany has been reported following vigorous diuresis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During therapy with ethacrynic acid, liberalization of salt intake and supplementary potassium chloride are often necessary.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When a metabolic alkalosis may be anticipated, e.g., in cirrhosis with ascites, the use of potassium chloride or a potassium-sparing agent before and during therapy with EDECRIN may mitigate or prevent the hypokalemia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Loop diuretics have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium; this may result in hypomagnesemia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The safety and efficacy of ethacrynic acid in hypertension have not been established.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, the dosage of coadministered antihypertensive agents may require adjustment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Orthostatic hypotension may occur in patients receiving other antihypertensive agents when given ethacrynic acid.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	EDECRIN has little or no effect on glomerular filtration or on renal blood flow, except following pronounced reductions in plasma volume when associated with rapid diuresis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A transient increase in serum urea nitrogen may occur.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Usually, this is readily reversible when the drug is discontinued.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	As with other diuretics used in the treatment of renal edema, hypoproteinemia may reduce responsiveness to ethacrynic acid and the use of salt-poor albumin should be considered.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	EDECRIN may increase the risk of gastric hemorrhage associated with corticosteroid treatment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Frequent serum electrolyte, CO2 and BUN determinations should be performed early in therapy and periodically thereafter during active diuresis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Any electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected or the drug temporarily withdrawn.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Increases in blood glucose and alterations in glucose tolerance tests have been observed in patients receiving EDECRIN.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There was no evidence of a tumorigenic effect in a 79-week oral chronic toxicity study in rats at doses up to 45 times the human dose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Ethacrynic acid had no effect on fertility in a two-litter study in rats or a two-generation study in mice at 10 times the human dose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Reproduction studies in the mouse and rabbit at doses up to 50 times the human dose showed no evidence of external abnormalities of the fetus due to EDECRIN.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a two-litter study in the dog and rat, oral doses of 5 or 20 mg/kg/day (2<U+00BD> or 10 times the human dose), respectively, did not interfere with pregnancy or with growth and development of the pups.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Although there was reduction in the mean body weights of the fetuses in a teratogenic study in the rat at a dose level of 100 mg/kg (50 times the human dose), there was no effect on mortality or postnatal development.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Functional and morphologic abnormalities were not observed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Since animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, EDECRIN should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from EDECRIN, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There are no well-controlled clinical trials in pediatric patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The information on oral dosing in pediatric patients, other than infants, is supported by evidence from empiric use in this age group.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For information on oral use in pediatric patients, other than infants, see INDICATIONS AND USAGE and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Safety and effectiveness of oral and parenteral use in infants have not been established.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Safety and effectiveness of intravenous use in pediatric patients have not been established.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of EDECRIN/SODIUM EDECRIN, approximately 224 patients (21%) were 65 to 74 years of age, while approximately 100 patients (9%) were 75 years of age and over.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effects of EDECRIN on electrolytes are related to its renal pharmacologic activity and are dose dependent.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The possibility of profound electrolyte and water loss may be avoided by weighing the patient throughout the treatment period, by careful adjustment of dosage, by initiating treatment with small doses, and by using the drug on an intermittent schedule when possible.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When excessive diuresis occurs, the drug should be withdrawn until homeostasis is restored.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When excessive electrolyte loss occurs, the dosage should be reduced or the drug temporarily withdrawn.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Initiation of diuretic therapy with EDECRIN in the cirrhotic patient with ascites is best carried out in the hospital.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When maintenance therapy has been established, the individual can be satisfactorily followed as an outpatient.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	EDECRIN should be given with caution to patients with advanced cirrhosis of the liver, particularly those with a history of previous episodes of electrolyte imbalance or hepatic encephalopathy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Like other diuretics it may precipitate hepatic coma and death.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Too vigorous a diuresis, as evidenced by rapid and excessive weight loss, may induce an acute hypotensive episode.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In elderly cardiac patients, rapid contraction of plasma volume and the resultant hemoconcentration should be avoided to prevent the development of thromboembolic episodes, such as cerebral vascular thromboses and pulmonary emboli which may be fatal.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Excessive loss of potassium in patients receiving digitalis glycosides may precipitate digitalis toxicity.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Care should also be exercised in patients receiving potassium-depleting steroids.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A number of possibly drug-related deaths have occurred in critically ill patients refractory to other diuretics.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These generally have fallen into two categories: (1) patients with severe myocardial disease who have been receiving digitalis and presumably developed acute hypokalemia with fatal arrhythmia; (2) patients with severely decompensated hepatic cirrhosis with ascites, with or without accompanying encephalopathy, who were in electrolyte imbalance and died because of intensification of the electrolyte defect.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Deafness, tinnitus, and vertigo with a sense of fullness in the ears have occurred, most frequently in patients with severe impairment of renal function.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These symptoms have been associated most often with intravenous administration and with doses in excess of those recommended.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The deafness has usually been reversible and of short duration (one to 24 hours).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, in some patients the hearing loss has been permanent.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A number of these patients were also receiving drugs known to be ototoxic.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	EDECRIN may increase the ototoxic potential of other drugs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lithium generally should not be given with diuretics.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Excretion Following subcutaneous administration of 240 mg FIRMAGON at a concentration of 40 mg/mL to prostate cancer patients, degarelix is eliminated in a biphasic fashion, with a median terminal half-life of approximately 53 days.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The long half-life after subcutaneous administration is a consequence of a very slow release of degarelix from the FIRMAGON depot formed at the injection site(s).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Approximately 20-30% of a given dose of degarelix was renally excreted, suggesting that approximately 70-80% is excreted via the hepato-biliary system in humans.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	It must not be used in the treatment of trivial infections or where it is not indicated, as in colds, influenza, infections of the throat; or as a prophylactic agent to prevent bacterial infections.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Precautions: It is essential that adequate blood studies be made during treatment with the drug.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	While blood studies may detect early peripheral blood changes, such as leukopenia, reticulocytopenia, or granulocytopenia, before they become irreversible, such studies cannot be relied on to detect bone marrow depression prior to development of aplastic anemia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	To facilitate appropriate studies and observation during therapy, it is desirable that patients be hospitalized.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Chloramphenicol is contraindicated in individuals with a history of previous hypersensitivity and/or toxic reaction to it.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concurrent therapy with other drugs that may cause bone marrow depression should be avoided.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	The use of this antibiotic, as with other antibiotics, may result in an overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If infections caused by nonsusceptible organisms appear during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Baseline blood studies should be followed by periodic blood studies approximately every two days during therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The drug should be discontinued upon appearance of reticulocytopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia or any other blood study findings attributable to chloramphenicol.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, it should be noted that such studies do not exclude the possible later appearance of the irreversible type of bone marrow depression.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	It is not known whether chloramphenicol can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Orally administered chloramphenicol has been shown to cross the placental barrier.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because of potential toxic effects on the fetus, chloramphenicol should be given to a pregnant woman only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Chloramphenicol is excreted in human milk following oral administration of the drug.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Clinical studies of chloramphenicol sodium succinate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Each gram (10 mL of a 10% solution) of chloramphenicol sodium succinate contains approximately 52 mg (2.25 mEq) of sodium.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	In controlled studies in adult volunteers using the recommended dosage of 50 mg/kg/day, a dosage of 1 g every 6 hours for 8 doses was given.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Using the microbiological assay method, the average peak serum level was 11.2 mcg/mL one hour after the first dose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A cumulative effect gave a peak rise to 18.4 mcg/mL after the fifth dose of 1 g. Mean serum levels ranged from 8 to 14 mcg/mL over the 48-hour period.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Total urinary excretion of chloramphenicol in these studies ranged from a low of 68% to a high of 99% over a three-day period.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	From 8% to 12% of the antibiotic excreted is in the form of free chloramphenicol; the remainder consists of microbiologically inactive metabolites, principally the conjugate with glucuronic acid.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Since the glucuronide is excreted rapidly, most chloramphenicol detected in the blood is in the microbiologically active free form.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Despite the small proportion of unchanged drug excreted in the urine, the concentration of free chloramphenicol is relatively high, amounting to several hundred mcg/mL in patients receiving divided doses of 50 mg/kg/day.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Small amounts of active drug are found in bile and feces.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Chloramphenicol diffuses rapidly, but its distribution is not uniform.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Highest concentrations are found in liver and kidney, and lowest concentrations are found in brain and cerebrospinal fluid.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Chloramphenicol enters cerebrospinal fluid even in the absence of meningeal inflammation, appearing in concentrations about half of those found in the blood.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Measurable levels are also detected in pleural and in ascitic fluids, saliva, milk, and in the aqueous and vitreous humors.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Transport across the placental barrier occurs with somewhat lower concentration in cord blood of neonates than in maternal blood.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Mechanism of Action Chloramphenicol is a broad-spectrum antibiotic originally isolated from Streptomyces venezuelae.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by interfering with the transfer of activated amino acids from soluble RNA to ribosomes.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In vitro, chloramphenicol exerts mainly a bacteriostatic effect on a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Antimicrobial Activity Chloramphenicol has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Aerobic gram-negative microorganisms Haemophilus influenzae Salmonella species, including Salmonella typhi Other microorganisms Lymphogranuloma-psittacosis group Rickettsia When available, the clinical microbiology laboratory should provide cumulative reports of in vitro susceptibility test results for antimicrobial drugs used in local hospitals and practice areas to the physician as periodic reports that describe the susceptibility profile of nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These reports should aid the physician in selecting an antibacterial drug for treatment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dilution Techniques Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The MICs should be determined using a standardized (broth and/or agar).1,3 The MIC values should be interpreted according to the criteria provided in Table 1.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Diffusion Techniques Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters can also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The zone size should be determined using a standardized test method.2,3 This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 30 mcg chloramphenicol to test the susceptibility of bacteria to chloramphenicol.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A report of Intermediate (I) indicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and, if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where a high dosage of the drug can be used.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This category also provides a buffer zone that prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A report of Resistant (R) indicates that the antimicrobial drug is not likely to inhibit growth of the pathogen if the antimicrobial drug reaches the concentration usually achievable at the infection site; other therapy should be selected.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Quality Control Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory controls to monitor and ensure the accuracy and precision of supplies and reagents used in the assay, and the techniques of the individuals performing the test.1,2,3 Standard chloramphenicol powder should provide the following range of MIC values noted in Table 2.

5	Comtan is contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to the drug or its ingredients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The recommended dose of Comtan (entacapone) is one 200 mg tablet administered concomitantly with each levodopa and carbidopa dose to a maximum of 8 times daily (200 mg <U+00C3><U+2014> 8 = 1,600 mg per day).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Clinical experience with daily doses above 1,600 mg is limited.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Comtan should always be administered in association with levodopa and carbidopa.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Entacapone has no antiparkinsonian effect of its own.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Comtan can be combined with both the immediate and sustained-release formulations of levodopa and carbidopa.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Comtan may be taken with or without food.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients with hepatic impairment should be treated with caution.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The AUC and Cmax of entacapone approximately doubled in patients with documented liver disease, compared to controls.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, these studies were conducted with single-dose entacapone without levodopa and dopa decarboxylase inhibitor coadministration, and therefore the effects of liver disease on the kinetics of chronically administered entacapone have not been evaluated.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rapid withdrawal or abrupt reduction in the Comtan dose could lead to emergence of signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease, and may lead to hyperpyrexia and confusion, a symptom complex resembling NMS.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis for any patient who develops a high fever or severe rigidity.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If a decision is made to discontinue treatment with Comtan, patients should be monitored closely and other dopaminergic treatments should be adjusted as needed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Although tapering Comtan has not been systematically evaluated, it seems prudent to withdraw patients slowly if the decision to discontinue treatment is made.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In vitro studies of human CYP enzymes showed that entacapone inhibited the CYP enzymes 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A only at very high concentrations (IC50 from 200 microM to over 1,000 microM; an oral 200 mg dose achieves a highest level of approximately 5 microM in people); these enzymes would therefore not be expected to be inhibited in clinical use.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In an interaction study in healthy volunteers, entacapone did not significantly change the plasma levels of S-warfarin, while the AUC for R-warfarin increased on average by 18% [CI90 11% to 26%], and the international normalized ratio (INR) values increased on average by 13% [CI90 6% to 19%].	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Nevertheless, cases of significantly increased INR in patients concomitantly using warfarin have been reported during the postapproval use of Comtan.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, monitoring of INR is recommended when entacapone treatment is initiated or when the dose is increased for patients receiving warfarin.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dopaminergic therapy in Parkinson's disease patients has been associated with orthostatic hypotension.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Entacapone enhances levodopa bioavailability and, therefore, might be expected to increase the occurrence of orthostatic hypotension.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In controlled studies, approximately 1.2% and 0.8% of 200 mg entacapone and placebo patients, respectively, reported at least one episode of syncope.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Reports of syncope were generally more frequent in patients in both treatment groups who had an episode of documented hypotension.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dopaminergic therapy in patients with Parkinson's disease has been associated with hallucinations.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In clinical studies, hallucinations led to drug discontinuation and premature withdrawal in 0.8% and 0% of patients treated with 200 mg Comtan and placebo, respectively.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hallucinations led to hospitalization in 1.0% and 0.3% of patients in the 200 mg Comtan and placebo groups, respectively.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Agitation occurred in 1% of patients treated with Comtan and 0% treated with placebo.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Postmarketing reports indicate that patients may experience new or worsening mental status and behavioral changes, which may be severe, including psychotic-like behavior during Comtan treatment or after starting or increasing the dose of Comtan.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Other drugs prescribed to improve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease can have similar effects on thinking and behavior.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Abnormal thinking and behavior can cause paranoid ideation, delusions, hallucinations, confusion, disorientation, aggressive behavior, agitation, and delirium.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Psychotic-like behaviors were also observed during the clinical development of Comtan.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients with a major psychotic disorder should ordinarily not be treated with Comtan because of the risk of exacerbating psychosis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In addition, certain medications used to treat psychosis may exacerbate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and may decrease the effectiveness of Comtan.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Postmarketing reports suggest that patients treated with anti-Parkinson medications can experience intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges, intense urges to spend money uncontrollably, and other intense urges.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients may be unable to control these urges while taking one or more of the medications that are used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and that increase central dopaminergic tone, including Comtan taken with levodopa and carbidopa.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In some cases, although not all, these urges were reported to have stopped when the dose of anti-Parkinson medications was reduced or discontinued.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal it is important for prescribers to specifically ask patients or their caregivers about the development of new or increased gambling urges, sexual urges, uncontrolled spending or other urges while being treated with entacapone.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Physicians should consider dose reduction or stopping Comtan if a patient develops such urges while taking Comtan.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In clinical studies, diarrhea developed in 60 of 603 (10%) and 16 of 400 (4%) of patients treated with 200 mg Comtan and placebo, respectively.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In patients treated with Comtan, diarrhea was generally mild to moderate in severity (8.6%) but was regarded as severe in 1.3%.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Diarrhea resulted in withdrawal in 10 of 603 (1.7%) patients, 7 (1.2%) with mild and moderate diarrhea and 3 (0.5%) with severe diarrhea.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Diarrhea generally resolved after discontinuation of Comtan.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Two patients with diarrhea were hospitalized.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Typically, diarrhea presents within 4 weeks to 12 weeks after entacapone is started, but it may appear as early as the first week and as late as many months after the initiation of treatment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Diarrhea may be associated with weight loss, dehydration, and hypokalemia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Postmarketing experience has shown that diarrhea may be a sign of drug-induced microscopic colitis, primarily lymphocytic colitis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In these cases, diarrhea has usually been moderate to severe, watery, and non-bloody, at times associated with dehydration, abdominal pain, weight loss, and hypokalemia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In the majority of cases, diarrhea and other colitis-related symptoms resolved or significantly improved when Comtan treatment was stopped.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In some patients with biopsy confirmed colitis, diarrhea had resolved or significantly improved after discontinuation of Comtan but recurred after retreatment with Comtan.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If prolonged diarrhea is suspected to be related to Comtan, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate medical therapy considered.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If the cause of prolonged diarrhea remains unclear or continues after stopping entacapone, then further diagnostic investigations including colonoscopy and biopsies should be considered.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Comtan may potentiate the dopaminergic side effects of levodopa and may cause or exacerbate preexisting dyskinesia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Although decreasing the dose of levodopa may ameliorate this side effect, many patients in controlled studies continued to experience frequent dyskinesia despite a reduction in their dose of levodopa.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The incidence of dyskinesia was 25% for treatment with Comtan and 15% for placebo.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The incidence of study withdrawal for dyskinesia was 1.5% for 200 mg Comtan and 0.8% for placebo.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The events listed below are events associated with the use of drugs that increase dopaminergic activity: Cases of severe rhabdomyolysis have been reported following the approval of Comtan.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Although the reactions typically occurred while patients were treated with Comtan, the complicated nature of these cases makes it difficult to determine what role, if any, Comtan played in their pathogenesis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Severe prolonged motor activity including dyskinesia may account for rhabdomyolysis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Signs and symptoms include fever, alteration of consciousness, myalgia, increased values of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and myoglobin.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cases of a symptom complex resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) characterized by elevated temperature, muscular rigidity, altered consciousness, and elevated CPK have been reported in association with the rapid dose reduction or withdrawal of other dopaminergic drugs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In most of these cases, symptoms began after abrupt discontinuation of treatment with entacapone or reduction of its dose, or after the initiation of treatment with entacapone.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The complicated nature of these cases makes it difficult to determine what role, if any, Comtan may have played in their pathogenesis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	No cases have been reported following the abrupt withdrawal or dose reduction of entacapone treatment during clinical studies.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Prescribers should exercise caution when discontinuing entacapone treatment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When considered necessary, withdrawal should proceed slowly.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If the decision is made to discontinue treatment with Comtan, recommendations include monitoring the patient closely and adjusting other dopaminergic treatments as needed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Tapering Comtan has not been systematically evaluated.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cases of retroperitoneal fibrosis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusion, and pleural thickening have been reported in some patients treated with ergot derived dopaminergic agents.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These complications may resolve when the drug is discontinued, but complete resolution does not always occur.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Although these adverse events are believed to be related to the ergoline structure of these compounds, whether other, nonergot derived drugs (e.g., entacapone) that increase dopaminergic activity can cause them is unknown.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It should be noted that the expected incidence of fibrotic complications is so low that even if entacapone caused these complications at rates similar to those attributable to other dopaminergic therapies, it is unlikely that it would have been detected in a cohort of the size exposed to entacapone.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Four cases of pulmonary fibrosis were reported during clinical development of entacapone; three of these patients were also treated with pergolide and one with bromocriptine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The duration of treatment with entacapone ranged from 7 months to 17 months.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Epidemiological studies have shown that patients with Parkinson's disease have a higher risk (2- to approximately 6-fold higher) of developing melanoma than the general population.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Whether the increased risk observed was due to Parkinson's disease or other factors, such as drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease, is unclear.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For the reasons stated above, patients and providers are advised to monitor for melanomas frequently and on a regular basis when using Comtan for any indication.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Ideally, periodic skin examinations should be performed by appropriately qualified individuals (e.g., dermatologists).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a 1-year toxicity study, entacapone (plasma exposure 20 times that in humans receiving the maximum recommended daily dose of 1,600 mg) caused an increased incidence of nephrotoxicity in male rats that was characterized by regenerative tubules, thickening of basement membranes, infiltration of mononuclear cells, and tubular protein casts.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These effects were not associated with changes in clinical chemistry parameters, and there is no established method for monitoring for the possible occurrence of these lesions in humans.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Although this toxicity could represent a species-specific effect, there is not yet evidence that this is so.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The AUC and Cmax of entacapone approximately doubled in patients with documented liver disease compared to controls.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Instruct patients to take Comtan only as prescribed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Inform patients that hallucinations and/or other psychotic-like behavior can occur.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Advise patients that they may develop postural (orthostatic) hypotension with or without symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, syncope, and sweating.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hypotension may occur more frequently during initial therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Accordingly, patients should be cautioned against rising rapidly after sitting or lying down, especially if they have been doing so for prolonged periods, and especially at the initiation of treatment with Comtan.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Advise patients that they should neither drive a car nor operate other complex machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on Comtan to gauge whether or not it affects their mental and/or motor performance adversely.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Warn patients about the possibility of sudden onset of sleep during daily activities, in some cases without awareness or warning signs, when they are taking dopaminergic agents, including Comtan.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because of the possible additive sedative effects, caution should be used when patients are taking other CNS depressants in combination with Comtan.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Inform patients that nausea may occur, especially at the initiation of treatment with Comtan.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Inform patients that diarrhea may occur with Comtan and it may have a delayed onset.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Sometimes prolonged diarrhea may be caused by colitis (inflammation of the large intestine).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients with diarrhea should drink fluids to maintain adequate hydration and monitor for weight loss.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If diarrhea associated with Comtan is prolonged, discontinuing the drug is expected to lead to resolution, if diarrhea continues after stopping entacapone, further diagnostic investigations may be needed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Advise patients about the possibility of an increase in dyskinesia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Tell patients that treatment with entacapone may cause a change in the color of their urine (a brownish orange discoloration) that is not clinically relevant.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In controlled studies, 10% of patients treated with Comtan reported urine discoloration compared to 0% of placebo patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Although Comtan has not been shown to be teratogenic in animals, it is always given in conjunction with levodopa and carbidopa, which is known to cause visceral and skeletal malformations in rabbits.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Accordingly, patients should be advised to notify their physicians if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Entacapone is excreted into maternal milk in rats.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because of the possibility that entacapone may be excreted into human maternal milk, advise patients to notify their physicians if they intend to breastfeed or are breastfeeding an infant.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Tell patients and family members to notify their healthcare practitioner if they notice that the patient develops unusual urges or behaviors.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The impact of entacapone on the body's iron stores is unknown; however, a tendency towards decreasing serum iron concentrations was noted in clinical studies.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a controlled clinical study, serum ferritin levels (as marker of iron deficiency and subclinical anemia) were not changed with entacapone compared to placebo after one year of treatment and there was no difference in rates of anemia or decreased hemoglobin levels.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Entacapone is highly protein bound (98%).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In vitro studies have shown no binding displacement between entacapone and other highly bound drugs, such as warfarin, salicylic acid, phenylbutazone, and diazepam.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Levodopa is known to depress prolactin secretion and increase growth hormone levels.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Treatment with entacapone coadministered with levodopa and dopa decarboxylase inhibitor does not change these effects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	See WARNINGS regarding concomitant use of Comtan and non-selective MAO inhibitors.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	No interaction was noted with the MAO-B inhibitor selegiline in two multiple-dose interaction studies when entacapone was coadministered with a levodopa and dopa decarboxylase inhibitor (n = 29).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	More than 600 patients with Parkinson's disease in clinical studies have used selegiline in combination with entacapone and levodopa and dopa decarboxylase inhibitor.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	As most entacapone excretion is via the bile, caution should be exercised when drugs known to interfere with biliary excretion, glucuronidation, and intestinal beta-glucuronidase are given concurrently with entacapone.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These include probenecid, cholestyramine, and some antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, rifampicin, ampicillin, and chloramphenicol).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	No interaction with the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine was shown in a single-dose study with entacapone without coadministered levodopa and dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Two-year carcinogenicity studies of entacapone were conducted in mice and rats.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In mice, no increase in tumors was observed at oral doses of 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg/day.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	At the highest dose tested, plasma exposures (AUC) were 4 times higher than that in humans at the maximum recommended daily dose (MRDD) of 1,600 mg.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In rats administered oral doses of 20, 90, or 400 mg/kg/day, an increased incidence of renal tubular adenomas and carcinomas was observed in males at the highest dose tested.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Plasma AUCs at the higher dose not associated with increased renal tumors (90 mg/kg/day) were approximately 5 times that in humans at the MRDD of entacapone.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The carcinogenic potential of entacapone administered in combination with levodopa and carbidopa has not been evaluated.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Entacapone was mutagenic and clastogenic in the in vitro mouse lymphoma tk assay in the presence and absence of metabolic activation, and was clastogenic in cultured human lymphocytes in the presence of metabolic activation.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Entacapone, either alone or in combination with levodopa and carbidopa, was not clastogenic in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test or mutagenic in the bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Entacapone did not impair fertility or general reproductive performance in rats treated with up to 700 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs 28 times those in humans receiving the MRDD of 1,600 mg).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Delayed mating, but no fertility impairment, was evident in female rats treated with 700 mg/kg/day of entacapone.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In embryo-fetal development studies, entacapone was administered to pregnant animals throughout organogenesis at doses of up to 1,000 mg/kg/day in rats and 300 mg/kg/day in rabbits.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Increased incidences of fetal variations were evident in litters from rats treated with the highest dose, in the absence of overt signs of maternal toxicity.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The maternal plasma drug exposure (AUC) associated with this dose was approximately 34 times the estimated plasma exposure in humans receiving the maximum recommended daily dose (MRDD) of 1,600 mg.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Increased frequencies of abortions, late and total resorptions, and decreased fetal weights were observed in the litters of rabbits treated with maternally toxic doses of 100 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs 0.4 times those in humans receiving the MRDD) or greater.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There was no evidence of teratogenicity in these studies.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, when entacapone was administered to female rats prior to mating and during early gestation, an increased incidence of fetal eye anomalies (macrophthalmia, microphthalmia, anophthalmia) was observed in the litters of dams treated with doses of 160 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs 7 times those in humans receiving the MRDD) or greater, in the absence of maternal toxicity.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Administration of up to 700 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs 28 times those in humans receiving the MRDD) to female rats during the latter part of gestation and throughout lactation produced no evidence of developmental impairment in the offspring.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Entacapone is always given concomitantly with levodopa and carbidopa, which is known to cause visceral and skeletal malformations in rabbits.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The teratogenic potential of entacapone in combination with levodopa and carbidopa was not assessed in animals.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There is no experience from clinical studies regarding the use of Comtan in pregnant women.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, Comtan should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In animal studies, entacapone was excreted into maternal rat milk.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is not known whether entacapone is excreted in human milk.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when entacapone is administered to a nursing woman.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Monoamine oxidase (MAO) and COMT are the two major enzyme systems involved in the metabolism of catecholamines.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is theoretically possible, therefore, that the combination of Comtan (entacapone) and a non-selective MAO inhibitor (e.g., phenelzine and tranylcypromine) would result in inhibition of the majority of the pathways responsible for normal catecholamine metabolism.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For this reason, patients should ordinarily not be treated concomitantly with Comtan and a non-selective MAO inhibitor.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Entacapone can be taken concomitantly with a selective MAO-B inhibitor (e.g., selegiline).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When a single 400 mg dose of entacapone was given with intravenous isoprenaline (isoproterenol) and epinephrine without coadministered levodopa and dopa decarboxylase inhibitor, the overall mean maximal changes in heart rate during infusion were about 50% and 80% higher than with placebo, for isoprenaline and epinephrine, respectively.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, drugs known to be metabolized by COMT, such as isoproterenol, epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, dobutamine, alpha-methyldopa, apomorphine, isoetherine, and bitolterol should be administered with caution in patients receiving entacapone regardless of the route of administration (including inhalation), as their interaction may result in increased heart rates, possible arrhythmias, and excessive changes in blood pressure.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Ventricular tachycardia was noted in one 32-year-old healthy male volunteer in an interaction study after epinephrine infusion and oral entacapone administration.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A causal relationship to entacapone administration appears probable but cannot be attributed with certainty.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients with Parkinson's disease treated with Comtan, which increases plasma levodopa levels, or with levodopa have reported suddenly falling asleep without prior warning of sleepiness while engaged in ADL (including the operation of motor vehicles).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Some of these episodes resulted in accidents.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Although many of these patients reported somnolence while on Comtan, some did not perceive warning signs, such as excessive drowsiness, and believed that they were alert immediately prior to the event.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Some of these events have been reported as late as one year after initiation of treatment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The risk of somnolence was increased (Comtan 2% and placebo 0%) in controlled studies.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It has been reported that falling asleep while engaged in ADL always occurs in a setting of preexisting somnolence, although patients may not give such a history.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For this reason, prescribers should reassess patients for drowsiness or sleepiness especially since some of the events occur well after the start of treatment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Prescribers should also be aware that patients may not acknowledge drowsiness or sleepiness until directly questioned about drowsiness or sleepiness during specific activities.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients should be advised to exercise caution while driving, operating machines, or working at heights during treatment with Comtan.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients who have already experienced somnolence and/or an episode of sudden sleep onset should not participate in these activities during treatment with Comtan.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Before initiating treatment with Comtan, advise patients of the potential to develop drowsiness and specifically ask about factors that may increase this risk such as concomitant use of sedating medications and the presence of sleep disorders.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If a patient develops daytime sleepiness or episodes of falling asleep during activities that require active participation (e.g., conversations, eating, etc.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	), Comtan should ordinarily be discontinued.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If the decision is made to continue Comtan, patients should be advised not to drive and to avoid other potentially dangerous activities.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There is insufficient information to establish whether dose reduction will eliminate episodes of falling asleep while engaged in ADL.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Entacapone is a selective and reversible inhibitor of COMT.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In mammals, COMT is distributed throughout various organs with the highest activities in the liver and kidney.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	COMT also occurs in the heart, lung, smooth and skeletal muscles, intestinal tract, reproductive organs, various glands, adipose tissue, skin, blood cells, and neuronal tissues, especially in glial cells.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	COMT catalyzes the transfer of the methyl group of S-adenosyl-L-methionine to the phenolic group of substrates that contain a catechol structure.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Physiological substrates of COMT include dopa, catecholamines (dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine) and their hydroxylated metabolites.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The function of COMT is the elimination of biologically active catechols and some other hydroxylated metabolites.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In the presence of a decarboxylase inhibitor, COMT becomes the major metabolizing enzyme for levodopa, catalyzing the metabolism to 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-L-phenylalanine (3-OMD) in the brain and periphery.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The mechanism of action of entacapone is believed to be through its ability to inhibit COMT and alter the plasma pharmacokinetics of levodopa.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The higher levodopa levels also lead to increased levodopa adverse effects, sometimes requiring a decrease in the dose of levodopa.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In animals, while entacapone enters the central nervous system (CNS) to a minimal extent, it has been shown to inhibit central COMT activity.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In humans, entacapone inhibits the COMT enzyme in peripheral tissues.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effects of entacapone on central COMT activity in humans have not been studied.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Studies in healthy volunteers have shown that entacapone reversibly inhibits human erythrocyte COMT activity after oral administration.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There was a linear correlation between entacapone dose and erythrocyte COMT inhibition, the maximum inhibition being 82% following an 800 mg single dose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	With a 200 mg single dose of entacapone, maximum inhibition of erythrocyte COMT activity is on average 65% with a return to baseline level within 8 hours.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In general, the average peak levodopa plasma concentration and the time of its occurrence (Tmax of 1 hour) are unaffected.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The onset of effect occurs after the first administration and is maintained during long-term treatment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Studies in Parkinson's disease patients suggest that the maximal effect occurs with 200 mg entacapone.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Plasma levels of 3-OMD are markedly and dose-dependently decreased by entacapone when given with levodopa and carbidopa.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Entacapone pharmacokinetics are linear over the dose range of 5 mg to 800 mg, and are independent of levodopa and carbidopa coadministration.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The elimination of entacapone is biphasic, with an elimination half-life of 0.4 hour to 0.7 hour based on the <U+03B2>-phase and 2.4 hours based on the <U+03B3>-phase.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The <U+03B3>-phase accounts for approximately 10% of the total AUC.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The total body clearance after intravenous administration is 850 mL per min.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	After a single 200 mg dose of Comtan (entacapone), the Cmax is approximately 1.2 mcg per mL.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Entacapone is rapidly absorbed, with a Tmax of approximately 1 hour.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The absolute bioavailability following oral administration is 35%.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food does not affect the pharmacokinetics of entacapone.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The volume of distribution of entacapone at steady state after intravenous injection is small (20 L).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Entacapone does not distribute widely into tissues due to its high plasma protein binding.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Based on in vitro studies, the plasma protein binding of entacapone is 98% over the concentration range of 0.4 mcg per mL to 50 mcg per mL.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Entacapone binds mainly to serum albumin.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Entacapone is almost completely metabolized prior to excretion, with only a very small amount (0.2% of dose) found unchanged in urine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The main metabolic pathway is isomerization to the cis-isomer, followed by direct glucuronidation of the parent and cis-isomer; the glucuronide conjugate is inactive.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	After oral administration of a 14C-labeled dose of entacapone, 10% of labeled parent and metabolite is excreted in urine and 90% in feces.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Entacapone pharmacokinetics are independent of age.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	No formal gender studies have been conducted.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Racial representation in clinical studies was largely limited to Caucasians; therefore, no conclusions can be reached about the effect of Comtan on groups other than Caucasian.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A single 200 mg dose of entacapone, without levodopa and dopa decarboxylase inhibitor coadministration, showed approximately 2-fold higher AUC and Cmax values in patients with a history of alcoholism and hepatic impairment (n = 10) compared to normal subjects (n = 10).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	All patients had biopsy-proven liver cirrhosis caused by alcohol.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	According to Child-Pugh grading seven patients with liver disease had mild hepatic impairment and three patients had moderate hepatic impairment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	As only about 10% of the entacapone dose is excreted in urine as parent compound and conjugated glucuronide, biliary excretion appears to be the major route of excretion of this drug.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Consequently, entacapone should be administered with care to patients with biliary obstruction.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The pharmacokinetics of entacapone have been investigated after a single 200 mg entacapone dose, without levodopa and dopa decarboxylase inhibitor coadministration, in a specific renal impairment study.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There were three groups: normal subjects (n = 7; creatinine clearance greater than 1.12 mL per sec per 1.73 m2), moderate impairment (n = 10; creatinine clearance ranging from 0.60 mL per sec per 1.73 m2 to 0.89 mL per sec per 1.73 m2), and severe impairment (n = 7; creatinine clearance ranging from 0.20 mL per sec per 1.73 m2 to 0.44 mL per sec per 1.73 m2).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	No important effects of renal function on the pharmacokinetics of entacapone were found.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effectiveness of Comtan (entacapone) as an adjunct to levodopa in the treatment of Parkinson's disease was established in three 24-week multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in patients with Parkinson's disease.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In two of these studies, patients had motor fluctuations, characterized by documented periods of On (periods of relatively good functioning) and Off (periods of relatively poor functioning), despite optimum levodopa therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There was also a withdrawal period following 6 months of treatment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In the third study, patients were not required to have motor fluctuations.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Prior to the controlled part of the studies, patients were stabilized on levodopa for 2 weeks to 4 weeks.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Comtan has not been systematically evaluated in patients who have Parkinson's disease without motor fluctuations.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In the first two studies to be described, patients were randomized to receive placebo or entacapone 200 mg administered concomitantly with each dose of levodopa and carbidopa (up to 10 times daily, but averaging 4 doses to 6 doses per day).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The formal double-blind portion of both studies was 6 months long.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients recorded the time spent in the On and Off states in home diaries periodically throughout the duration of the study.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In one study, conducted in the Nordic countries, the primary outcome measure was the total mean time spent in the On state during an 18-hour diary recorded day (6 AM to midnight).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In the other study, the primary outcome measure was the proportion of awake time spent over 24 hours in the On state.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In addition to the primary outcome measure: the amount of time spent in the Off state, subparts of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) including mentation (Part I), activities of daily living (ADL) (Part II), motor function (Part III), complications of therapy (Part IV), and disease staging (Part V and VI) were assessed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Additional secondary endpoints included the investigator's and patient's global assessment of clinical condition, a 7-point subjective scale designed to assess global functioning in Parkinson's disease; and the change in daily levodopa and carbidopa dose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In one of the studies, 171 patients were randomized in 16 centers in Finland, Norway, Sweden, and Denmark (Nordic study), all of whom received concomitant levodopa plus dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor (either levodopa and carbidopa or levodopa and benserazide).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In the second study, 205 patients were randomized in 17 centers in North America (US and Canada); all patients received concomitant levodopa and carbidopa.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The following tables display the results of these two studies: Table 1.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	In the North American study, abrupt withdrawal of entacapone, without alteration of the dose of levodopa and carbidopa, resulted in a significant worsening of fluctuations, compared to placebo.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In some cases, symptoms were slightly worse than at baseline, but returned to approximately baseline severity within two weeks following levodopa dose increase on average by 80 mg.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In the Nordic study, similarly, a significant worsening of parkinsonian symptoms was observed after entacapone withdrawal, as assessed two weeks after drug withdrawal.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Type 1 diabetes mellitus, diabetic ketoacidosis, with or without coma.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This condition should be treated with insulin.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There is no fixed dosage regimen for the management of diabetes mellitus with GLUCOTROL or any other hypoglycemic agent.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In addition to the usual monitoring of urinary glucose, the patient's blood glucose must also be monitored periodically to determine the minimum effective dose for the patient; to detect primary failure, i.e., inadequate lowering of blood glucose at the maximum recommended dose of medication; and to detect secondary failure, i.e., loss of an adequate blood-glucose-lowering response after an initial period of effectiveness.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Glycosylated hemoglobin levels may also be of value in monitoring the patient's response to therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Short-term administration of GLUCOTROL may be sufficient during periods of transient loss of control in patients usually controlled well on diet.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In general, GLUCOTROL should be given approximately 30 minutes before a meal to achieve the greatest reduction in postprandial hyperglycemia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The recommended starting dose is 5 mg, given before breakfast.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Geriatric patients or those with liver disease may be started on 2.5 mg.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dosage adjustments should ordinarily be in increments of 2.5<U+2013>5 mg, as determined by blood glucose response.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	At least several days should elapse between titration steps.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If response to a single dose is not satisfactory, dividing that dose may prove effective.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The maximum recommended once daily dose is 15 mg. Doses above 15 mg should ordinarily be divided and given before meals of adequate caloric content.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The maximum recommended total daily dose is 40 mg.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Some patients may be effectively controlled on a once-a-day regimen, while others show better response with divided dosing.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Total daily doses above 15 mg should ordinarily be divided.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Total daily doses above 30 mg have been safely given on a b.i.d. basis to long-term patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In elderly patients, debilitated or malnourished patients, and patients with impaired renal or hepatic function, the initial and maintenance dosing should be conservative to avoid hypoglycemic reactions.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	As with other sulfonylurea-class hypoglycemics, many stable non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients receiving insulin may be safely placed on GLUCOTROL.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When transferring patients from insulin to GLUCOTROL, the following general guidelines should be considered: For patients whose daily insulin requirement is 20 units or less, insulin may be discontinued and GLUCOTROL therapy may begin at usual dosages.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Several days should elapse between GLUCOTROL titration steps.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For patients whose daily insulin requirement is greater than 20 units, the insulin dose should be reduced by 50% and GLUCOTROL therapy may begin at usual dosages.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Subsequent reductions in insulin dosage should depend on individual patient response.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During the insulin withdrawal period, the patient should test urine samples for sugar and ketone bodies at least three times daily.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients should be instructed to contact the prescriber immediately if these tests are abnormal.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In some cases, especially when patient has been receiving greater than 40 units of insulin daily, it may be advisable to consider hospitalization during the transition period.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	As with other sulfonylurea-class hypoglycemics, no transition period is necessary when transferring patients to GLUCOTROL.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients should be observed carefully (1<U+2013>2 weeks) for hypoglycemia when being transferred from longer half-life sulfonylureas (e.g., chlorpropamide) to GLUCOTROL due to potential overlapping of drug effect.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, GLUCOTROL should be administered at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The hypoglycemic action of sulfonylureas may be potentiated by certain drugs including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, some azoles, and other drugs that are highly protein bound, salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, probenecid, coumarins, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, quinolones and beta adrenergic blocking agents.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving GLUCOTROL, the patient should be observed closely for hypoglycemia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When such drugs are withdrawn from a patient receiving GLUCOTROL, the patient should be observed closely for loss of control.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In vitro binding studies with human serum proteins indicate that GLUCOTROL binds differently than tolbutamide and does not interact with salicylate or dicumarol.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, caution must be exercised in extrapolating these findings to the clinical situation and in the use of GLUCOTROL with these drugs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of control.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These drugs include the thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel blocking drugs, and isoniazid.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving GLUCOTROL, the patient should be closely observed for loss of control.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When such drugs are withdrawn from a patient receiving GLUCOTROL, the patient should be observed closely for hypoglycemia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A potential interaction between oral miconazole and oral hypoglycemic agents leading to severe hypoglycemia has been reported.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Whether this interaction also occurs with the intravenous, topical, or vaginal preparations of miconazole is not known.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effect of concomitant administration of DIFLUCAN<U+00AE> (fluconazole) and GLUCOTROL has been demonstrated in a placebo-controlled crossover study in normal volunteers.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	All subjects received GLUCOTROL alone and following treatment with 100 mg of DIFLUCAN as a single daily oral dose for 7 days.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When glipizide ER was administered 4 hours prior to colesevelam, there was no significant change in glipizide AUC0<U+2013><U+221E> or Cmax, -4% and 0%, respectively.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with GLUCOTROL or any other anti-diabetic drug.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The metabolism and excretion of GLUCOTROL may be slowed in patients with impaired renal and/or hepatic function.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If hypoglycemia should occur in such patients, it may be prolonged and appropriate management should be instituted.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	All sulfonylurea drugs are capable of producing severe hypoglycemia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Proper patient selection, dosage, and instructions are important to avoid hypoglycemic episodes.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Renal or hepatic insufficiency may cause elevated blood levels of GLUCOTROL and the latter may also diminish gluconeogenic capacity, both of which increase the risk of serious hypoglycemic reactions.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Elderly, debilitated or malnourished patients, and those with adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, are particularly susceptible to the hypoglycemic action of glucose-lowering drugs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in the elderly, and in people who are taking beta-adrenergic blocking drugs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hypoglycemia is more likely to occur when caloric intake is deficient, after severe or prolonged exercise, when alcohol is ingested, or when more than one glucose-lowering drug is used.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When a patient stabilized on any diabetic regimen is exposed to stress such as fever, trauma, infection, or surgery, a loss of control may occur.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	At such times, it may be necessary to discontinue GLUCOTROL and administer insulin.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effectiveness of any oral hypoglycemic drug, including GLUCOTROL, in lowering blood glucose to a desired level decreases in many patients over a period of time, which may be due to progression of the severity of the diabetes or to diminished responsiveness to the drug.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This phenomenon is known as secondary failure, to distinguish it from primary failure in which the drug is ineffective in an individual patient when first given.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Treatment of patients with glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency with sulfonylurea agents can lead to hemolytic anemia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because GLUCOTROL belongs to the class of sulfonylurea agents, caution should be used in patients with G6PD deficiency and a non-sulfonylurea alternative should be considered.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In post-marketing reports, hemolytic anemia has also been reported in patients who did not have known G6PD deficiency.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Blood and urine glucose should be monitored periodically.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Measurement of glycosylated hemoglobin may be useful.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients should be informed of the potential risks and advantages of GLUCOTROL and of alternative modes of therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	They should also be informed about the importance of adhering to dietary instructions, of a regular exercise program, and of regular testing of urine and/or blood glucose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The risks of hypoglycemia, its symptoms and treatment, and conditions that predispose to its development should be explained to patients and responsible family members.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Primary and secondary failure should also be explained.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In initiating treatment for type 2 diabetes, diet should be emphasized as the primary form of treatment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Caloric restriction and weight loss are essential in the obese diabetic patient.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Proper dietary management alone may be effective in controlling the blood glucose and symptoms of hyperglycemia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The importance of regular physical activity should also be stressed, and cardiovascular risk factors should be identified and corrective measures taken where possible.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Use of GLUCOTROL or other antidiabetic medications must be viewed by both the physician and patient as a treatment in addition to diet and not as a substitution or as a convenient mechanism for avoiding dietary restraint.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Furthermore, loss of blood glucose control on diet alone may be transient, thus requiring only short-term administration of GLUCOTROL or other antidiabetic medications.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Maintenance or discontinuation of GLUCOTROL or other antidiabetic medications should be based on clinical judgment using regular clinical and laboratory evaluations.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A twenty month study in rats and an eighteen month study in mice at doses up to 75 times the maximum human dose revealed no evidence of drug-related carcinogenicity.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Bacterial and in vivo mutagenicity tests were uniformly negative.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Studies in rats of both sexes at doses up to 75 times the human dose showed no effects on fertility.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	GLUCOTROL (glipizide) was found to be mildly fetotoxic in rat reproductive studies at all dose levels (5<U+2013>50 mg/kg).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This fetotoxicity has been similarly noted with other sulfonylureas, such as tolbutamide and tolazamide.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effect is perinatal and believed to be directly related to the pharmacologic (hypoglycemic) action of GLUCOTROL.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In studies in rats and rabbits, no teratogenic effects were found.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	GLUCOTROL should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because recent information suggests that abnormal blood glucose levels during pregnancy are associated with a higher incidence of congenital abnormalities, many experts recommend that insulin be used during pregnancy to maintain blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Prolonged severe hypoglycemia (4 to 10 days) has been reported in neonates born to mothers who were receiving a sulfonylurea drug at the time of delivery.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This has been reported more frequently with the use of agents with prolonged half-lives.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If GLUCOTROL is used during pregnancy, it should be discontinued at least one month before the expected delivery date.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Although it is not known whether GLUCOTROL is excreted in human milk, some sulfonylurea drugs are known to be excreted in human milk.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because the potential for hypoglycemia in nursing infants may exist, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If the drug is discontinued and if diet alone is inadequate for controlling blood glucose, insulin therapy should be considered.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A determination has not been made whether controlled clinical studies of GLUCOTROL included sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to define a difference in response from younger subjects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The administration of oral hypoglycemic drugs has been reported to be associated with increased cardiovascular mortality as compared to treatment with diet alone or diet plus insulin.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This warning is based on the study conducted by the University Group Diabetes Program (UGDP), a long-term prospective clinical trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of glucose-lowering drugs in preventing or delaying vascular complications in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The study involved 823 patients who were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups (Diabetes, 19, supp.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	UGDP reported that patients treated for 5 to 8 years with diet plus a fixed dose of tolbutamide (1.5 grams per day) had a rate of cardiovascular mortality approximately 2<U+00BD> times that of patients treated with diet alone.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A significant increase in total mortality was not observed, but the use of tolbutamide was discontinued based on the increase in cardiovascular mortality, thus limiting the opportunity for the study to show an increase in overall mortality.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Despite controversy regarding the interpretation of these results, the findings of the UGDP study provide an adequate basis for this warning.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The patient should be informed of the potential risks and advantages of GLUCOTROL and of alternative modes of therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Although only one drug in the sulfonylurea class (tolbutamide) was included in this study, it is prudent from a safety standpoint to consider that this warning may also apply to other oral hypoglycemic drugs in this class, in view of their close similarities in mode of action and chemical structure.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The primary mode of action of GLUCOTROL in experimental animals appears to be the stimulation of insulin secretion from the beta cells of pancreatic islet tissue and is thus dependent on functioning beta cells in the pancreatic islets.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In humans, GLUCOTROL appears to lower the blood glucose acutely by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreas, an effect dependent upon functioning beta cells in the pancreatic islets.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The mechanism by which GLUCOTROL lowers blood glucose during long-term administration has not been clearly established.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In man, stimulation of insulin secretion by GLUCOTROL in response to a meal is undoubtedly of major importance.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Fasting insulin levels are not elevated even on long-term GLUCOTROL administration, but the postprandial insulin response continues to be enhanced after at least 6 months of treatment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The insulinotropic response to a meal occurs within 30 minutes after an oral dose of GLUCOTROL in diabetic patients, but elevated insulin levels do not persist beyond the time of the meal challenge.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Extrapancreatic effects may play a part in the mechanism of action of oral sulfonylurea hypoglycemic drugs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Blood sugar control persists in some patients for up to 24 hours after a single dose of GLUCOTROL, even though plasma levels have declined to a small fraction of peak levels by that time.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Some patients fail to respond initially, or gradually lose their responsiveness to sulfonylurea drugs, including GLUCOTROL.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Alternatively, GLUCOTROL may be effective in some patients who have not responded or have ceased to respond to other sulfonylureas.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It has been shown that GLUCOTROL therapy was effective in controlling blood sugar without deleterious changes in the plasma lipoprotein profiles of patients treated for NIDDM.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a placebo-controlled, crossover study in normal volunteers, GLUCOTROL had no antidiuretic activity and, in fact, led to a slight increase in free water clearance.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Gastrointestinal absorption of GLUCOTROL in man is uniform, rapid, and essentially complete.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Peak plasma concentrations occur 1<U+2013>3 hours after a single oral dose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The half-life of elimination ranges from 2<U+2013>4 hours in normal subjects, whether given intravenously or orally.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The metabolic and excretory patterns are similar with the two routes of administration, indicating that first-pass metabolism is not significant.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	GLUCOTROL does not accumulate in plasma on repeated oral administration.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thus, GLUCOTROL was more effective when administered about 30 minutes before, rather than with, a test meal in diabetic patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Protein binding was studied in serum from volunteers who received either oral or intravenous GLUCOTROL and found to be 98<U+2013>99% one hour after either route of administration.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The apparent volume of distribution of GLUCOTROL after intravenous administration was 11 liters, indicative of localization within the extracellular fluid compartment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In mice, no GLUCOTROL or metabolites were detectable autoradiographically in the brain or spinal cord of males or females, nor in the fetuses of pregnant females.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In another study, however, very small amounts of radioactivity were detected in the fetuses of rats given labelled drug.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The metabolism of GLUCOTROL is extensive and occurs mainly in the liver.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The primary metabolites are inactive hydroxylation products and polar conjugates and are excreted mainly in the urine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Less than 10% unchanged GLUCOTROL is found in the urine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Individualize and adjust the dosage of HUMULIN R based on the route of administration, the patient's metabolic needs, blood glucose monitoring results, and glycemic control goal.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dosage adjustments may be needed with changes in physical activity, changes in meal patterns (e.g., macronutrient content or timing of food intake), changes in renal or hepatic function, or during acute illness.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dosage adjustment may be needed when switching from another insulin to HUMULIN R.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dosage adjustment may be needed when HUMULIN R is co-administered with certain drugs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	After deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn 4 to 6 hours after the injection.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Periodic platelet counts, hematocrits, and tests for occult blood in stool are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Converting to Oral Anticoagulant When an oral anticoagulant of the coumarin or similar type is to be begun in patients already receiving heparin sodium, baseline and subsequent tests of prothrombin activity must be determined at a time when heparin activity is too low to affect the prothrombin time.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This is about 5 hours after the last intravenous bolus and 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If continuous intravenous heparin infusion is used, prothrombin time can usually be measured at any time.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In converting from heparin to an oral anticoagulant, the dose of the oral anticoagulant should be the usual initial amount and thereafter prothrombin time should be determined at the usual intervals.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	To ensure continuous anticoagulation, it is advisable to continue full heparin therapy for several days after the prothrombin time has reached the therapeutic range.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect With Full-Dose Heparin Although dosage must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION FREQUENCY RECOMMENDED DOSE [based on 150 lb (68 kg) patient] Deep, Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection A different site should be used for each injection to prevent the development of massive hematoma.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: Initial Dose 75 to 100 units/kg ( Intravenous bolus over 10 minutes) Maintenance Dose Infants: 25 to 30 units/kg/hour; Infants <2 months have the highest requirements (average 28 units/kg/hour) Children >1 year of age: 18 to 20 units/kg/hour; Older children may require less heparin, similar to weight-adjusted adult dosage Monitoring Adjust heparin to maintain aPTT of 60 to 85 seconds, assuming this reflects an anti-Factor Xa level of 0.35 to 0.70 Geriatric Use Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Surgery of the Heart and Blood Vessels Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Frequently, a dose of 300 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes, or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism A number of well-controlled clinical trials have demonstrated that low-dose heparin prophylaxis, given just prior to and after surgery, will reduce the incidence of postoperative deep vein thrombosis in the legs (as measured by the I-125 fibrinogen technique and venography) and of clinical pulmonary embolism.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The heparin is given by deep subcutaneous injection in the arm or abdomen with a fine needle (25 to 26 gauge) to minimize tissue trauma.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A concentrated solution of heparin sodium is recommended.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Such prophylaxis should be reserved for patients over the age of 40 who are undergoing major surgery.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients with bleeding disorders and those having neurosurgery, spinal anesthesia, eye surgery or potentially sanguineous operations should be excluded, as should patients receiving oral anticoagulants or platelet-active drugs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The value of such prophylaxis in hip surgery has not been established.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The possibility of increased bleeding during surgery or postoperatively should be borne in mind.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If such bleeding occurs, discontinuance of heparin and neutralization with protamine sulfate is advisable.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If clinical evidence of thromboembolism develops despite low-dose prophylaxis, full therapeutic doses of anticoagulants should be given unless contraindicated.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	All patients should be screened prior to heparinization to rule out bleeding disorders, and monitoring should be performed with appropriate coagulation tests just prior to surgery.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Coagulation test values should be normal or only slightly elevated.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There is usually no need for daily monitoring of the effect of low-dose heparin in patients with normal coagulation parameters.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturers' operating directions carefully.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Blood Transfusion Addition of 400 to 600 USP units per 100 mL of whole blood is usually employed to prevent coagulation.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Usually, 7,500 USP units of heparin sodium are added to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or 75,000 USP units per 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP) and mixed; from this sterile solution, 6 mL to 8 mL are added per 100 mL of whole blood.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Laboratory Samples Addition of 70 to 150 units of heparin sodium per 10 to 20 mL sample of whole blood is usually employed to prevent coagulation of the sample.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Laboratory Tests Periodic platelet counts, hematocrits, and tests for occult blood in stool are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drug Interactions Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn, if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as acetylsalicylic acid, dextran, phenylbutazone, ibuprofen, indomethacin, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Other Interactions Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Hyperaminotransferasemia Significant elevations of aminotransferase (SGOT [S-AST] and SGPT [S-ALT]) levels have occurred in a high percentage of patients (and healthy subjects) who have received heparin.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Since aminotransferase determinations are important in the differential diagnosis of myocardial infarction, liver disease and pulmonary emboli, increases that might be caused by drugs (like heparin) should be interpreted with caution.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No long-term studies in animals have been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential of heparin.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Also, no reproduction studies in animals have been performed concerning mutagenesis or impairment of fertility.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Use preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection in neonates and infants.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The preservative benzyl alcohol has been associated with serious adverse events and death in pediatric patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The gasping syndrome (characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, gasping respirations, and high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites found in the blood and urine) has been associated with benzyl alcohol dosages >99 mg/kg/day in neonates and low-birth weight infants.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Additional symptoms may include gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hemorrhage Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An unexplained fall in hematocrit, fall in blood pressure or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Heparin sodium should be used with extreme caution in disease states in which there is increased danger of hemorrhage.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Some of the conditions in which increased danger of hemorrhage exists are: Cardiovascular <U+2014> Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia has been reported to occur in patients receiving heparin with a reported incidence of up to 30%.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Platelet counts should be obtained at baseline and periodically during heparin administration.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Mild thrombocytopenia (count greater than 100,000/mm3) may remain stable or reverse even if heparin is continued.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, thrombocytopenia of any degree should be monitored closely.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If the count falls below 100,000/mm3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops With or Without Thrombosis ), the heparin product should be discontinued and, if necessary, an alternative anticoagulant administered.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) (With or Without Thrombosis) HIT is a serious immune-mediated reaction resulting from irreversible aggregation of platelets.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as HIT with thrombosis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HIT.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and fatal outcomes.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Once HIT (with or without thrombosis) is diagnosed or strongly suspected, all heparin sodium sources (including heparin flushes) should be discontinued and an alternative anticoagulant used.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Future use of heparin sodium, especially within 3 to 6 months following the diagnosis of HIT (with or without thrombosis), and while patients test positive for HIT antibodies, should be avoided.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Immune-mediated HIT is diagnosed based on clinical findings supplemented by laboratory tests confirming the presence of antibodies to heparin sodium, or platelet activation induced by heparin sodium.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A drop in platelet count greater than 50% from baseline is considered indicative of HIT.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Platelet counts begin to fall 5 to 10 days after exposure to heparin sodium in heparin sodium-na<U+00C3><U+00AF>ve individuals, and reach a threshold by days 7 to 14.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In contrast, rapid onset HIT can occur very quickly (within 24 hours following heparin sodium initiation), especially in patients with a recent exposure to heparin sodium (i.e. previous 3 months).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thrombosis development shortly after documenting thrombocytopenia is a characteristic finding in almost half of all patients with HIT.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thrombocytopenia of any degree should be monitored closely.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Heparin inhibits reactions that lead to the clotting of blood and the formation of fibrin clots both in vitro and in vivo.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Heparin acts at multiple sites in the normal coagulation system.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Small amounts of heparin in combination with antithrombin III (heparin cofactor) can inhibit thrombosis by inactivating activated Factor X and inhibiting the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Once active thrombosis has developed, larger amounts of heparin can inhibit further coagulation by inactivating thrombin and preventing the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Clotting time is prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, it is not measurably affected by low doses of heparin.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (APTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Peak plasma levels of heparin are achieved 2 to 4 hours following subcutaneous administration, although there are considerable individual variations.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Loglinear plots of heparin plasma concentrations with time, for a wide range of dose levels, are linear, which suggests the absence of zero order processes.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Liver and reticulo-endothelial system are the sites of biotransformation.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The biphasic elimination curve, a rapidly declining alpha phase (t1/2 = 10 min.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	), and after the age of 40 a slower beta phase, indicates uptake in organs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The absence of a relationship between anticoagulant half-life and concentration half-life may reflect factors such as protein binding of heparin.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Contraindicated in patients with glaucoma, pyloric or duodenal obstruction, stenosing peptic ulcers, prostatic hypertrophy or obstruction of the bladder neck, cardio-spasm (megaesophagus) and myasthenia gravis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	There are insufficient data to determine whether pioglitazone is a tumor promoter for urinary bladder tumors.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Consequently, ACTOS should not be used in patients with active bladder cancer and the benefits of glycemic control versus unknown risks for cancer recurrence with ACTOS should be considered in patients with a prior history of bladder cancer.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In controlled clinical trials, edema was reported more frequently in patients treated with ACTOS than in placebo-treated patients and is dose-related.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In postmarketing experience, reports of new onset or worsening edema have been received.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	ACTOS should be used with caution in patients with edema.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because thiazolidinediones, including ACTOS, can cause fluid retention, which can exacerbate or lead to congestive heart failure, ACTOS should be used with caution in patients at risk for congestive heart failure.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients treated with ACTOS should be monitored for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In PROactive (the Prospective Pioglitazone Clinical Trial in Macrovascular Events), 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of macrovascular disease were randomized to ACTOS (N=2605), force-titrated up to 45 mg daily or placebo (N=2633) in addition to standard of care.

5	Activation of PPAR<U+03B3> nuclear receptors modulates the transcription of a number of insulin responsive genes involved in the control of glucose and lipid metabolism.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In animal models of diabetes, pioglitazone reduces the hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia characteristic of insulin-resistant states such as type 2 diabetes.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The metabolic changes produced by pioglitazone result in increased responsiveness of insulin-dependent tissues and are observed in numerous animal models of insulin resistance.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because pioglitazone enhances the effects of circulating insulin (by decreasing insulin resistance), it does not lower blood glucose in animal models that lack endogenous insulin.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Clinical studies demonstrate that ACTOS improves insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	During extended prophylaxis, no cases of moderate or severe thrombocytopenia were reported.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Moderate thrombocytopenia occurred at a rate of 0.5% in patients given the ARIXTRA treatment regimen in the DVT and PE treatment clinical trials.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Severe thrombocytopenia occurred at a rate of 0.04% in patients given the ARIXTRA treatment regimen in the DVT and PE treatment clinical trials.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Occurrences of thrombocytopenia with thrombosis that manifested similar to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia have been reported with the use of ARIXTRA in postmarketing experience.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Routine coagulation tests such as Prothrombin Time (PT) and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) are relatively insensitive measures of the activity of ARIXTRA and international standards of heparin or LMWH are not calibrators to measure anti-Factor Xa activity of ARIXTRA.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If unexpected changes in coagulation parameters or major bleeding occur during therapy with ARIXTRA, discontinue ARIXTRA.In postmarketing experience, occurrences of aPTT elevations have been reported following administration of ARIXTRA.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Periodic routine complete blood counts (including platelet count), serum creatinine level, and stool occult blood tests are recommended during the course of treatment with ARIXTRA.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The anti-Factor Xa activity of fondaparinux sodium can be measured by anti-Xa assay using the appropriate calibrator (fondaparinux).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The activity of fondaparinux sodium is expressed in milligrams (mg) of the fondaparinux and cannot be compared with activities of heparin or low molecular weight heparins.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The packaging (needle guard) of the prefilled syringe of ARIXTRA contains dry natural latex rubber that may cause allergic reactions in latex sensitive individuals.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The antithrombotic activity of fondaparinux sodium is the result of antithrombin III (ATIII)-mediated selective inhibition of Factor Xa.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	By selectively binding to ATIII, fondaparinux sodium potentiates (about 300 times) the innate neutralization of Factor Xa by ATIII.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Neutralization of Factor Xa interrupts the blood coagulation cascade and thus inhibits thrombin formation and thrombus development.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Fondaparinux sodium does not inactivate thrombin (activated Factor II) and has no known effect on platelet function.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	At the recommended dose, fondaparinux sodium does not affect fibrinolytic activity or bleeding time.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The pharmacodynamics/pharmacokinetics of fondaparinux sodium are derived from fondaparinux plasma concentrations quantified via anti-Factor Xa activity.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Only fondaparinux can be used to calibrate the anti-Xa assay.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	(The international standards of heparin or LMWH are not appropriate for this use.)	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The mean peak steady-state plasma concentration is in the range of 1.20 to 1.26 mg/L.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In these patients, the mean minimum steady-state plasma concentration is in the range of 0.46 to 0.62 mg/L.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In healthy adults, intravenously or subcutaneously administered fondaparinux sodium distributes mainly in blood and only to a minor extent in extravascular fluid as evidenced by steady state and non-steady state apparent volume of distribution of 7 to 11 L. Similar fondaparinux distribution occurs in patients undergoing elective hip surgery or hip fracture surgery.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In vitro, fondaparinux sodium is highly (at least 94%) and specifically bound to antithrombin III (ATIII) and does not bind significantly to other plasma proteins (including platelet Factor 4 [PF4]) or red blood cells.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In vivo metabolism of fondaparinux has not been investigated since the majority of the administered dose is eliminated unchanged in urine in individuals with normal kidney function.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In individuals with normal kidney function, fondaparinux is eliminated in urine mainly as unchanged drug.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In healthy individuals up to 75 years of age, up to 77% of a single subcutaneous or intravenous fondaparinux dose is eliminated in urine as unchanged drug in 72 hours.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The elimination half-life is 17 to 21 hours.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Fondaparinux elimination is prolonged in patients with renal impairment since the major route of elimination is urinary excretion of unchanged drug.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In patients undergoing prophylaxis following elective hip surgery or hip fracture surgery, the total clearance of fondaparinux is approximately 25% lower in patients with mild renal impairment (CrCl 50 to 80 mL/min), approximately 40% lower in patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30 to 50 mL/min), and approximately 55% lower in patients with severe renal impairment (<30 mL/min) compared to patients with normal renal function.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A similar relationship between fondaparinux clearance and extent of renal impairment was observed in DVT treatment patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Following a single, subcutaneous dose of 7.5 mg of ARIXTRA in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Category B), Cmax and AUC were decreased by 22% and 39%, respectively, compared to subjects with normal liver function.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	A similar relationship between fondaparinux clearance and age was observed in DVT treatment patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Total clearance of fondaparinux sodium is decreased by approximately 30% in patients weighing less than 50 kg.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The pharmacokinetic properties of fondaparinux sodium are not significantly affected by gender.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	The recommended dosage of NUVIGIL for patients with OSA or narcolepsy is 150 mg to 250 mg taken orally once a day as a single dose in the morning.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In patients with OSA, doses up to 250 mg/day, given as a single dose, have been well tolerated, but there is no consistent evidence that these doses confer additional benefit beyond that of the 150 mg/day dose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The recommended dosage of NUVIGIL for patients with SWD is 150 mg taken orally once a day as a single dose approximately 1 hour prior to the start of their work shift.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Psychiatric Symptoms: use particular caution in treating patients with a history of psychosis, depression, or mania.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Consider discontinuing NUVIGIL if psychiatric symptoms develop.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Known Cardiovascular Disease: consider increased monitoring.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Serious rash requiring hospitalization and discontinuation of treatment has been reported in association with the use of NUVIGIL (armodafinil) or modafinil (the racemic mixture of S- and R-enantiomers).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	NUVIGIL has not been studied in pediatric patients in any setting and is not approved for use in pediatric patients for any indication.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In clinical trials of modafinil, the incidence of rash resulting in discontinuation was approximately 0.8% (13 per 1,585) in pediatric patients (age <17 years); these rashes included 1 case of possible Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and 1 case of apparent multi-organ hypersensitivity reaction/ Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Several of the cases were associated with fever and other abnormalities (e.g., vomiting, leukopenia).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The median time to rash that resulted in discontinuation was 13 days.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	No such cases were observed among 380 pediatric patients who received placebo.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Skin and mouth sores, blistering, and ulceration have been reported with modafinil and NUVIGIL in the postmarketing setting.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Recurrence of signs and symptoms of serious dermatologic reactions following rechallenge has been reported in some cases.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rare cases of serious or life-threatening rash, including SJS and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), have been reported in adults and children in worldwide postmarketing experience with modafinil and NUVIGIL.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There are no factors, including duration of therapy, that are known to predict the risk of occurrence or the severity of rash associated with modafinil or NUVIGIL.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In cases where the time to onset was reported, serious rash occurred 1 day to 2 months after initiation of treatment, but isolated cases of serious dermatologic reactions have been reported with symptoms beginning after prolonged treatment (e.g., 3 months).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Although benign rashes also occur with NUVIGIL, it is not possible to reliably predict which rashes will prove to be serious.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Accordingly, NUVIGIL should be discontinued at the first sign of rash, skin or mouth sores, or blistering or ulceration, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Discontinuation of treatment may not prevent a rash from becoming life-threatening or permanently disabling or disfiguring.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	DRESS, also known as multi-organ hypersensitivity, has been reported with NUVIGIL.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematologic abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis, sometimes resembling an acute viral infection.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This disorder is variable in its expression, and other organ systems not noted here may be involved.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy) may be present even though rash is not evident.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	One fatal case of DRESS that occurred in close temporal association (3 weeks) with the initiation of NUVIGIL treatment has been reported in the postmarketing setting.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In addition, multi-organ hypersensitivity reactions, including at least one fatality in postmarketing experience, have occurred in close temporal association (median time to detection 13 days; range 4-33) to the initiation of modafinil.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Although there have been a limited number of reports, multi-organ hypersensitivity reactions may result in hospitalization or be life-threatening.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If a multi-organ hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, NUVIGIL should be discontinued.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Although there are no case reports to indicate cross-sensitivity with other drugs that produce this syndrome, the experience with drugs associated with multi-organ hypersensitivity would indicate this to be a possibility.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Angioedema and hypersensitivity (with rash, dysphagia, and bronchospasm), were observed with NUVIGIL.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients should be advised to discontinue therapy and immediately report to their physician any signs or symptoms suggesting angioedema or anaphylaxis (e.g., swelling of face, eyes, lips, tongue or larynx; difficulty in swallowing or breathing; hoarseness).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients with abnormal levels of sleepiness who take NUVIGIL should be advised that their level of wakefulness may not return to normal.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients with excessive sleepiness, including those taking NUVIGIL, should be frequently reassessed for their degree of sleepiness and, if appropriate, advised to avoid driving or any other potentially dangerous activity.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Prescribers should also be aware that patients may not acknowledge sleepiness or drowsiness until directly questioned about drowsiness or sleepiness during specific activities.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In pre-approval narcolepsy, OSA and SWD controlled trials of NUVIGIL, anxiety, agitation, nervousness, and irritability were reasons for treatment discontinuation more often in patients on NUVIGIL compared to placebo (NUVIGIL 1.2% and placebo 0.3%).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Depression was also a reason for treatment discontinuation more often in patients on NUVIGIL compared to placebo (NUVIGIL 0.6% and placebo 0.2%).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cases of suicidal ideation were observed in clinical trials.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Caution should be exercised when NUVIGIL is given to patients with a history of psychosis, depression, or mania.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If psychiatric symptoms develop in association with NUVIGIL administration, consider discontinuing NUVIGIL.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Psychiatric adverse reactions have been reported in patients treated with modafinil.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Modafinil and NUVIGIL (armodafinil) are very closely related.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the incidence and type of psychiatric symptoms associated with NUVIGIL are expected to be similar to the incidence and type of these events with modafinil.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Postmarketing adverse reactions associated with the use of NUVIGIL, some of which have resulted in hospitalization, have included mania, delusions, hallucinations, suicidal ideation, and aggression.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Many, but not all, patients who developed psychiatric adverse reactions had a prior psychiatric history.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In these cases, reported NUVIGIL total daily doses ranged from 50 mg to 450 mg, which includes doses below and above the recommended dosages.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Although NUVIGIL has not been shown to produce functional impairment, any drug affecting the central nervous system (CNS) may alter judgment, thinking or motor skills.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients should be cautioned about operating an automobile or other hazardous machinery until it is reasonably certain that NUVIGIL therapy will not adversely affect their ability to engage in such activities.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In clinical studies of modafinil, cardiovascular adverse reactions, including chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea and transient ischemic T-wave changes on ECG were observed in three subjects in association with mitral valve prolapse or left ventricular hypertrophy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is recommended that NUVIGIL tablets not be used in patients with a history of left ventricular hypertrophy or in patients with mitral valve prolapse who have experienced the mitral valve prolapse syndrome when previously receiving CNS stimulants.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Findings suggestive of mitral valve prolapse syndrome include but are not limited to ischemic ECG changes, chest pain, or arrhythmia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If new onset of any of these findings occurs, consider cardiac evaluation.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Blood pressure monitoring in short term (<U+2264> 3 months) pre-approval controlled trials of OSA, SWD, and narcolepsy showed small average increases in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure in patients receiving NUVIGIL as compared to placebo (1.2 to 4.3 mmHg in the various experimental groups).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There was also a slightly greater proportion of patients on NUVIGIL requiring new or increased use of antihypertensive medications (2.9%) compared to patients on placebo (1.8%).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There was a small, but consistent, average increase in pulse rate over placebo in pre-approval controlled trials.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This increase varied from 0.9 to 3.5 BPM.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Increased monitoring of heart rate and blood pressure may be appropriate in patients on NUVIGIL.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Caution should be exercised when prescribing NUVIGIL to patients with known cardiovascular disease.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The mechanism(s) through which armodafinil promotes wakefulness is unknown.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Armodafinil (R-modafinil) has pharmacological properties similar to those of modafinil (a mixture of R- and S-modafinil), to the extent tested in animal and in vitro studies.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The R- and S-enantiomers have similar pharmacological actions in animals.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Armodafinil and modafinil have wake-promoting actions similar to sympathomimetic agents including amphetamine and methylphenidate, although their pharmacologic profile is not identical to that of the sympathomimetic amines.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Modafinil-induced wakefulness can be attenuated by the <U+03B1>1-adrenergic receptor antagonist, prazosin; however, modafinil is inactive in other in vitro assay systems known to be responsive to <U+03B1>-adrenergic agonists such as the rat vas deferens preparation.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Armodafinil is an indirect dopamine receptor agonist; both armodafinil and modafinil bind in vitro to the dopamine transporter and inhibit dopamine reuptake.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For modafinil, this activity has been associated in vivo with increased extracellular dopamine levels in some brain regions of animals.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In genetically engineered mice lacking the dopamine transporter (DAT), modafinil lacked wake-promoting activity, suggesting that this activity was DAT-dependent.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, the wake-promoting effects of modafinil, unlike those of amphetamine, were not antagonized by the dopamine receptor antagonist haloperidol in rats.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In addition, alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine, a dopamine synthesis inhibitor, blocks the action of amphetamine, but does not block locomotor activity induced by modafinil.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In addition to its wake-promoting effects and ability to increase locomotor activity in animals, modafinil produces psychoactive and euphoric effects, alterations in mood, perception, thinking, and feelings typical of other CNS stimulants in humans.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Modafinil has reinforcing properties, as evidenced by its self-administration in monkeys previously trained to self-administer cocaine; modafinil was also partially discriminated as stimulant-like.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Based on nonclinical studies, two major metabolites, acid and sulfone, of modafinil or armodafinil, do not appear to contribute to the CNS-activating properties of the parent compounds.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Armodafinil exhibits linear time-independent kinetics following single and multiple oral dose administration.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Increase in systemic exposure is proportional over the dose range of 50 to 400 mg. No time-dependent change in kinetics was observed through 12 weeks of dosing.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Apparent steady state for armodafinil was reached within 7 days of dosing.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	At steady state, the systemic exposure for armodafinil is 1.8 times the exposure observed after a single dose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The concentration-time profiles of the R-enantiomer following administration of a single-dose of 50 mg NUVIGIL or 100 mg PROVIGIL (modafinil, a 1:1 mixture of R- and S-enantiomers) are nearly superimposable.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, the Cmax and AUC0-<U+221E>, of armodafinil at steady-state were approximately 37% and 70% higher, respectively, following administration of 200 mg NUVIGIL than the corresponding values of modafinil following administration of 200 mg PROVIGIL due to the more rapid clearance of the S-enantiomer (elimination half-life approximately 4 hours) as compared to the R-enantiomer.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Absorption NUVIGIL is readily absorbed after oral administration.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The absolute oral bioavailability was not determined due to the aqueous insolubility of armodafinil, which precluded intravenous administration.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Peak plasma concentrations are attained at approximately 2 hours in the fasted state.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Since the delay in tmax is also associated with elevated plasma concentrations later in time, food can potentially affect the onset and time course of pharmacologic action for NUVIGIL.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Distribution NUVIGIL has an apparent volume of distribution of approximately 42 L. Data specific to armodafinil protein binding are not available.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, modafinil is moderately bound to plasma protein (approximately 60%), mainly to albumin.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The potential for interactions of NUVIGIL with highly protein<U+2011>bound drugs is considered to be minimal.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Elimination After oral administration of NUVIGIL, armodafinil exhibits an apparent monoexponential decline from the peak plasma concentration.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The apparent terminal t<U+00BD> is approximately 15 hours.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The oral clearance of NUVIGIL is approximately 33 mL/min.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Metabolism In vitro and in vivo data show that armodafinil undergoes hydrolytic deamidation, S-oxidation, and aromatic ring hydroxylation, with subsequent glucuronide conjugation of the hydroxylated products.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Amide hydrolysis is the single most prominent metabolic pathway, with sulfone formation by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4/5 being next in importance.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The other oxidative products are formed too slowly in vitro to enable identification of the enzyme(s) responsible.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Only two metabolites reach appreciable concentrations in plasma (i.e., R-modafinil acid and modafinil sulfone).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Excretion Data specific to NUVIGIL disposition are not available.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, modafinil is mainly eliminated via metabolism, predominantly in the liver, with less than 10% of the parent compound excreted in the urine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A total of 81% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in 11 days post-dose, predominantly in the urine (80% vs. 1.0% in the feces).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Specific Populations Age In a clinical study, systemic exposure of armodafinil was approximately 15% higher in elderly subjects (<U+2265>65 years of age, N=24), corresponding to approximately 12% lower oral clearance (CL/F), as compared to young subjects (18-45 years of age, N=25).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Systemic exposure of armodafinil acid (metabolite) was approximately 61% and 73% greater for Cmax and AUC0-<U+03C4>, respectively, compared to young subjects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Systemic exposure of the sulfone metabolite was approximately 20% lower for elderly subjects compared with young subjects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A subgroup analysis of elderly subjects demonstrated elderly subjects <U+2265>75 and 65-74 years of age had approximately 21% and 9% lower oral clearance, respectively, compared to young subjects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Systemic exposure was approximately 10% greater in subjects 65-74 years of age (N=17) and 27% greater in subjects <U+2265>75 years of age (N=7), respectively, when compared to young subjects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The change is considered not likely to be clinically significant for elderly patients, however, because some elderly patients have greater exposure to armodafinil, consideration should be given to the use of lower doses.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Sex Population pharmacokinetic analysis suggests no gender effect on the pharmacokinetics of armodafinil.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Ethnicity The influence of race/ethnicity on the pharmacokinetics of armodafinil has not been studied.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics and metabolism of modafinil were examined in patients with cirrhosis of the liver (6 men and 3 women).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Three patients had stage B or B+ cirrhosis and 6 patients had stage C or C+ cirrhosis (per the Child-Pugh score criteria).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Clinically 8 of 9 patients were icteric and all had ascites.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In these patients, the oral clearance of modafinil was decreased by about 60% and the steady state concentration was doubled compared to normal patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Renal Impairment In a single dose 200 mg modafinil study, severe chronic renal failure (creatinine clearance <U+2264>20 mL/min) did not significantly influence the pharmacokinetics of modafinil, but exposure to modafinil acid (metabolite) was increased 9-fold.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drug Interactions In vitro data demonstrated that armodafinil weakly induces CYP1A2 and possibly CYP3A activities in a concentration-related manner and that CYP2C19 activity is reversibly inhibited by armodafinil.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Other CYP activities did not appear to be affected by armodafinil.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An in vitro study demonstrated that armodafinil is a substrate of P-glycoprotein.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Potential Interactions with Drugs That Inhibit, Induce, or Are Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes and Other Hepatic Enzymes The existence of multiple pathways for armodafinil metabolism, as well as the fact that a non-CYP-related pathway is the most rapid in metabolizing armodafinil, suggest that there is a low probability of substantive effects on the overall pharmacokinetic profile of NUVIGIL due to CYP inhibition by concomitant medications.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, due to the partial involvement of CYP3A enzymes in the metabolic elimination of armodafinil, coadministration of potent inducers of CYP3A4/5 (e.g., carbamazepine, phenobarbital, rifampin) or inhibitors of CYP3A4/5 (e.g., ketoconazole, erythromycin) could alter the plasma concentrations of armodafinil.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The Potential of NUVIGIL to Alter the Metabolism of Other Drugs by Enzyme Induction or Inhibition Drugs Metabolized by CYP3A4/5 In vitro data demonstrated that armodafinil is a weak inducer of CYP3A activity in a concentration-related manner.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drugs Metabolized by CYP1A2 In vitro data demonstrated that armodafinil is a weak inducer of CYP1A2 in a concentration-related manner.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, in a clinical study using caffeine as a probe substrate, no significant effect on CYP1A2 activity was observed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drugs Metabolized by CYP2C19 In vitro data demonstrated that armodafinil is a reversible inhibitor of CYP2C19 activity.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, the following available drug-drug interaction information on modafinil should be applicable to NUVIGIL.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Interaction with P-Glycoprotein An in vitro study demonstrated that armodafinil is a substrate of P-glycoprotein.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The impact of inhibition of P-glycoprotein is not known.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Interactions with Other Drugs Data specific to NUVIGIL drug-drug interaction potential for additional other drugs are not available.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, the following available drug-drug interaction information on modafinil should be applicable to NUVIGIL.Warfarin: Concomitant administration of modafinil with warfarin did not produce significant changes in the pharmacokinetic profiles of R- and S-warfarin.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, since only a single dose of warfarin was tested in this study, an interaction cannot be ruled out.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Seconal Sodium is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to barbiturates.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is also contraindicated in patients with a history of manifest or latent porphyria, marked impairment of liver function, or respiratory disease in which dyspnea or obstruction is evident.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dosages of barbiturates must be individualized with full knowledge of their particular characteristics.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Factors of consideration are the patient's age, weight, and condition.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Adults As a hypnotic, 100 mg at bedtime.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Preoperatively, 200 to 300 mg 1 to 2 hours before surgery.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Pediatric Patients Preoperatively, 2 to 6 mg/kg, with a maximum dosage of 100 mg. Special patient population Dosage should be reduced in the elderly or debilitated because these patients may be more sensitive to barbiturates.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dosage should be reduced for patients with impaired renal function or hepatic disease.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drug Interactions Most reports of clinically significant drug interactions occurring with the barbiturates have involved phenobarbital.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, the application of these data to other barbiturates appears valid and warrants serial blood level determinations of the relevant drugs when there are multiple therapies.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Anticoagulants Phenobarbital lowers the plasma levels of dicumarol and causes a decrease in anticoagulant activity as measured by the prothrombin time.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients stabilized on anticoagulant therapy may require dosage adjustments if barbiturates are added to or withdrawn from their dosage regimen.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients stabilized on corticosteroid therapy may require dosage adjustments if barbiturates are added to or withdrawn from their dosage regimen.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, it would be preferable to avoid concomitant administration of these drugs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If barbiturates and doxycycline are administered concurrently, the clinical response to doxycycline should be monitored closely.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Phenytoin, Sodium Valproate, Valproic Acid The effect of barbiturates on the metabolism of phenytoin appears to be variable.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Some investigators report an accelerating effect, whereas others report no effect.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because the effect of barbiturates on the metabolism of phenytoin is not predictable, phenytoin and barbiturate blood levels should be monitored more frequently if these drugs are given concurrently.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CNS Depressants The concomitant use of other CNS depressants, including other sedatives or hypnotics, antihistamines, tranquilizers, or alcohol, may produce additive depressant effects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) MAOIs prolong the effects of barbiturates, probably because metabolism of the barbiturate is inhibited.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There have been reports of patients treated with antiepileptic drugs (eg, phenobarbital) who become pregnant while taking oral contraceptives.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An alternate contraceptive method might be suggested to women taking barbiturates.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	General Barbiturates may be habit-forming.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Tolerance and psychological and physical dependence may occur with continuing use.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Barbiturates should be administered with caution, if at all, to patients who are mentally depressed, have suicidal tendencies, or have a history of drug abuse.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Elderly or debilitated patients may react to barbiturates with marked excitement, depression, or confusion.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In some persons, especially pediatric patients, barbiturates repeatedly produce excitement rather than depression.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In patients with hepatic damage, barbiturates should be administered with caution and initially in reduced doses.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Barbiturates should not be administered to patients showing the premonitory signs of hepatic coma.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Information for Patients Sleep-Driving and Other Complex Behaviors There have been reports of people getting out of bed after taking a sedative-hypnotic and driving their cars while not fully awake, often with no memory of the event.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If a patient experiences such an episode, it should be reported to his or her doctor immediately, since sleep-driving can be dangerous.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This behavior is more likely to occur when sedative-hypnotics are taken with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Other complex behaviors (e.g., preparing and eating food, making phone calls, or having sex) have been reported in patients who are not fully awake after taking a sedative-hypnotic.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	As with <U+201C>sleep-driving<U+201D>, patients usually do not remember these events.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The following information should be given to patients receiving Seconal Sodium: 1.The use of Seconal Sodium carries with it an associated risk of psychological and/or physical dependence.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The patient should be warned against increasing the dose of the drug without consulting a physician.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	2.Seconal Sodium may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks, such as driving a car or operating machinery.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The patient should be cautioned accordingly.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	3.Alcohol should not be consumed while taking Seconal Sodium.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The concurrent use of Seconal Sodium with other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, narcotics, tranquilizers, and antihistamines) may result in additional CNS-depressant effects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Laboratory Tests Prolonged therapy with barbiturates should be accompanied by periodic laboratory evaluation of organic systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic systems.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Carcinogenesis Animal Data Phenobarbital sodium is carcinogenic in mice and rats after lifetime administration.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In mice, it produced benign and malignant liver cell tumors.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In rats, benign liver cell tumors were observed very late in life.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Human Data In a 29-year epidemiologic study of 9,136 patients who were treated on an anticonvulsant protocol that included phenobarbital, results indicated a higher than normal incidence of hepatic carcinoma.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Previously, some of these patients had been treated with thorotrast, a drug that is known to produce hepatic carcinomas.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thus, this study did not provide sufficient evidence that phenobarbital sodium is carcinogenic in humans.A retrospective study of 84 pediatric patients with brain tumors matched to 73 normal controls and 78 cancer controls (malignant disease other than brain tumors) suggested an association between exposure to barbiturates prenatally and an increased incidence of brain tumors.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects See WARNINGS, Usage in Pregnancy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Nonteratogenic Effects Reports of infants suffering from long-term barbiturate exposure in utero included the acute withdrawal syndrome of seizures and hyperirritability from birth to a delayed onset of up to 14 days.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Labor and Delivery Hypnotic doses of barbiturates do not appear to impair uterine activity significantly during labor.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Full anesthetic doses of barbiturates decrease the force and frequency of uterine contractions.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Administration of sedative-hypnotic barbiturates to the mother during labor may result in respiratory depression in the newborn.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Premature infants are particularly susceptible to the depressant effects of barbiturates.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If barbiturates are used during labor and delivery, resuscitation equipment should be available.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Data are not available to evaluate the effect of barbiturates when forceps delivery or other intervention is necessary or to determine the effect of barbiturates on the later growth, development, and functional maturity of the pediatric patient.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Nursing Mothers Caution should be exercised when Seconal Sodium is administered to a nursing woman, because small amounts of barbiturates are excreted in the milk.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because sleep disturbances may be the presenting manifestation of a physical and/or psychiatric disorder, symptomatic treatment of insomnia should be initiated only after a careful evaluation of the patient.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The failure of insomnia to remit after 7 to 10 days of treatment may indicate the presence of a primary psychiatric and/or medical illness that should be evaluated.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Worsening of insomnia or the emergence of new thinking or behavior abnormalities may be the consequence of an unrecognized psychiatric or physical disorder.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Such findings have emerged during the course of treatment with sedative-hypnotic drugs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because some of the important adverse effects of sedative-hypnotics appear to be dose related, it is important to use the smallest possible effective dose, especially in the elderly.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Complex behaviors such as sleep-driving (i.e., driving while not fully awake after ingestion of a sedative-hypnotic, with amnesia for the event) have been reported.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These events can occur in sedative-hypnotic-na<U+00C3><U+00AF>ve as well as in sedative-hypnotic-experienced persons.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Although behaviors such as <U+201C>sleep-driving<U+201D> may occur with sedative-hypnotics alone at therapeutic doses, the use of alcohol and other CNS depressants with sedative-hypnotics appears to increase the risk of such behaviors, as does the use of sedative-hypnotics at doses exceeding the maximum recommended dose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Due to the risk to the patient and the community, discontinuation of sedative-hypnotics should be strongly considered for patients who report a sleep-driving episode.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	As with <U+201C>sleep-driving<U+201D> patients usually do not remember these events.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Habit-Forming Seconal Sodium may be habit-forming.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Tolerance and psychological and physical dependence may occur with continued use.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients who have psychological dependence on barbiturates may increase the dosage or decrease the dosage interval without consulting a physician and subsequently may develop a physical dependence on barbiturates.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	To minimize the possibility of overdosage or development of dependence, the prescribing and dispensing of sedative-hypnotic barbiturates should be limited to the amount required for the interval until the next appointment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The abrupt cessation after prolonged use in a person who is dependent on the drug may result in withdrawal symptoms, including delirium, convulsions, and possibly death.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Barbiturates should be withdrawn gradually from any patient known to be taking excessive doses over long periods of time.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Acute or Chronic Pain Caution should be exercised when barbiturates are administered to patients with acute or chronic pain, because paradoxical excitement could be induced or important symptoms could be masked.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Usage in Pregnancy Barbiturates can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Retrospective, case-controlled studies have suggested that there may be a connection between the maternal consumption of barbiturates and a higher than expected incidence of fetal abnormalities.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Barbiturates readily cross the placental barrier and are distributed throughout fetal tissues; the highest concentrations are found in the placenta, fetal liver, and brain.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Fetal blood levels approach maternal blood levels following parenteral administration.Withdrawal symptoms occur in infants born to women who receive barbiturates throughout the last trimester of pregnancy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If Seconal Sodium is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Synergistic Effects The concomitant use of alcohol or other CNS depressants may produce additive CNS-depressant effects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Barbiturates are capable of producing all levels of CNS mood alteration, from excitation to mild sedation, hypnosis, and deep coma.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In high enough therapeutic doses, barbiturates induce anesthesia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Barbiturates depress the sensory cortex, decrease motor activity, alter cerebellar function, and produce drowsiness, sedation, and hypnosis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Barbiturate-induced sleep differs from physiologic sleep.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Sleep laboratory studies have demonstrated that barbiturates reduce the amount of time spent in the rapid eye movement (REM) phase, or dreaming stage of sleep.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Also, Stages III and IV sleep are decreased.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Following abrupt cessation of regularly used barbiturates, patients may experience markedly increased dreaming, nightmares, and/or insomnia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, withdrawal of a single therapeutic dose over 5 or 6 days has been recommended to lessen the REM rebound and disturbed sleep that contribute to drug withdrawal syndrome (for example, decreasing the dose from 3 to 2 doses a day for 1 week).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In studies, secobarbital sodium and pentobarbital sodium have been found to lose most of their effectiveness for both inducing and maintaining sleep by the end of 2 weeks of continued drug administration, even with the use of multiple doses.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	As with secobarbital sodium and pentobarbital sodium, other barbiturates (including amobarbital) might be expected to lose their effectiveness for inducing and maintaining sleep after about 2 weeks.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The short-, intermediate-, and to a lesser degree, long-acting barbiturates have been widely prescribed for treating insomnia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Although the clinical literature abounds with claims that the short-acting barbiturates are superior for producing sleep whereas the intermediate-acting compounds are more effective in maintaining sleep, controlled studies have failed to demonstrate these differential effects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, as sleep medications, the barbiturates are of limited value beyond short-term use.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Barbiturates have little analgesic action at subanesthetic doses.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rather, in subanesthetic doses, these drugs may increase the reaction to painful stimuli.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	All barbiturates exhibit anticonvulsant activity in anesthetic doses.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, of the drugs in this class, only phenobarbital, mephobarbital, and metharbital are effective as oral anticonvulsants in subhypnotic doses.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Barbiturates are respiratory depressants, and the degree of depression is dependent on the dose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	With hypnotic doses, respiratory depression is similar to that which occurs during physiologic sleep accompanied by a slight decrease in blood pressure and heart rate.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Studies in laboratory animals have shown that barbiturates cause reduction in the tone and contractility of the uterus, ureters, and urinary bladder.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, concentrations of the drugs required to produce this effect in humans are not reached with sedative-hypnotic doses.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Barbiturates do not impair normal hepatic function, but have been shown to induce liver microsomal enzymes, thus increasing and/or altering the metabolism of barbiturates and other drugs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Pharmacokinetics Barbiturates are absorbed in varying degrees following oral or parenteral administration.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The salts are more rapidly absorbed than are the acids.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The rate of absorption is increased if the sodium salt is ingested as a dilute solution or taken on an empty stomach.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Duration of action, which is related to the rate at which the barbiturates are redistributed throughout the body, varies among persons and in the same person from time to time.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Seconal Sodium is classified as a short-acting barbiturate when taken orally.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Its onset of action is 10 to 15 minutes and its duration of action ranges from 3 to 4 hours.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Barbiturates are weak acids that are absorbed and rapidly distributed to all tissues and fluids, with high concentrations in the brain, liver, and kidneys.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lipid solubility of the barbiturates is the dominant factor in their distribution within the body.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The more lipid soluble the barbiturate, the more rapidly it penetrates all tissues of the body.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Barbiturates are bound to plasma and tissue proteins to a varying degree, with the degree of binding increasing directly as a function of lipid solubility.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Phenobarbital has the lowest lipid solubility, lowest plasma binding, lowest brain protein binding, the longest delay in onset of activity, and the longest duration of action.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	At the opposite extreme is secobarbital, which has the highest lipid solubility, highest plasma protein binding, highest brain protein binding, the shortest delay in onset of activity, and the shortest duration of action.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The plasma half-life for secobarbital sodium in adults ranges between 15 to 40 hours, with a mean of 28 hours.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	No data are available for pediatric patients and newborns.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Barbiturates are metabolized primarily by the hepatic microsomal enzyme system, and the metabolic products are excreted in the urine and, less commonly, in the feces.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The excretion of unmetabolized barbiturate is 1 feature that distinguishes the long-acting category from those belonging to other categories, which are almost entirely metabolized.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The inactive metabolites of the barbiturates are excreted as conjugates of glucuronic acid.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hepatotoxicity General Population: Hepatic failure resulting in fatalities has occurred in patients receiving valproate and its derivatives.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These incidents usually have occurred during the first six months of treatment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Serious or fatal hepatotoxicity may be preceded by non-specific symptoms such as malaise, weakness, lethargy, facial edema, anorexia, and vomiting.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In patients with epilepsy, a loss of seizure control may also occur.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients should be monitored closely for appearance of these symptoms.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Serum liver tests should be performed prior to therapy and at frequent intervals thereafter, especially during the first six months.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Children under the age of two years are at a considerably increased risk of developing fatal hepatotoxicity, especially those on multiple anticonvulsants, those with congenital metabolic disorders, those with severe seizure disorders accompanied by mental retardation, and those with organic brain disease.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When Depacon is used in this patient group, it should be used with extreme caution and as a sole agent.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The benefits of therapy should be weighed against the risks.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The incidence of fatal hepatotoxicity decreases considerably in progressively older patient groups.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients with Mitochondrial Disease: There is an increased risk of valproate-induced acute liver failure and resultant deaths in patients with hereditary neurometabolic syndromes caused by DNA mutations of the mitochondrial DNA Polymerase <U+03B3> (POLG) gene (e.g.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Depacon is contraindicated in patients known to have mitochondrial disorders caused by POLG mutations and children under two years of age who are clinically suspected of having a mitochondrial disorder.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In patients over two years of age who are clinically suspected of having a hereditary mitochondrial disease, Depacon should only be used after other anticonvulsants have failed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This older group of patients should be closely monitored during treatment with Depacon for the development of acute liver injury with regular clinical assessments and serum liver testing.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	POLG mutation screening should be performed in accordance with current clinical practice.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Fetal Risk Valproate can cause major congenital malformations, particularly neural tube defects (e.g., spina bifida).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In addition, valproate can cause decreased IQ scores following in utero exposure.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Valproate should only be used to treat pregnant women with epilepsy if other medications have failed to control their symptoms or are otherwise unacceptable.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Valproate should not be administered to a woman of childbearing potential unless the drug is essential to the management of her medical condition.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This is especially important when valproate use is considered for a condition not usually associated with permanent injury or death (e.g., migraine).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Women should use effective contraception while using valproate.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Pancreatitis Cases of life-threatening pancreatitis have been reported in both children and adults receiving valproate.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Some of the cases have been described as hemorrhagic with a rapid progression from initial symptoms to death.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cases have been reported shortly after initial use as well as after several years of use.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients and guardians should be warned that abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and/or anorexia can be symptoms of pancreatitis that require prompt medical evaluation.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If pancreatitis is diagnosed, valproate should ordinarily be discontinued.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Alternative treatment for the underlying medical condition should be initiated as clinically indicated.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	WARNING: LIFE THREATENING ADVERSE REACTIONS See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hepatotoxicity, including fatalities, usually during the first 6 months of treatment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Children under the age of two years and patients with mitochondrial disorders are at higher risk.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Monitor patients closely, and perform serum liver testing prior to therapy and at frequent intervals thereafter (5.1) Fetal Risk, particularly neural tube defects, other major malformations, and decreased IQ (5.2, 5.3, 5.4) Pancreatitis, including fatal hemorrhagic cases (5.5)	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Depacon should not be administered to patients with hepatic disease or significant hepatic dysfunction.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Depacon is contraindicated in patients known to have mitochondrial disorders caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA polymerase <U+03B3> (POLG; e.g., Alpers-Huttenlocher Syndrome) and children under two years of age who are suspected of having a POLG-related disorder.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Depacon is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Depacon is contraindicated in patients with known urea cycle disorders.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hepatic disease or significant hepatic dysfunction (4, 5.1) Known mitochondrial disorders caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA polymerase <U+03B3> (POLG) (4, 5.1) Suspected POLG-related disorder in children under two years of age (4, 5.1) Known hypersensitivity to the drug (4, 5.11) Urea cycle disorders (4, 5.6)	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Depacon is intended for intravenous use only.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Epilepsy Complex Partial Seizures in Adults and Children 10 years of age or older: Initial dose is 10 to 15 mg/kg/day, increasing at 1 week intervals by 5 to10 mg/kg/day to achieve optimal clinical response.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Maximum recommended dose is 60 mg/kg/day (2.1).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Simple and Complex Absence Seizures: Initial dose is 10 to 15 mg/kg/day, increasing at 1 week intervals by 5 to 10 mg/kg/day to achieve optimal clinical response.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Use of Depacon for periods of more than 14 days has not been studied.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients should be switched to oral valproate products as soon as it is clinically feasible.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Depacon should be administered as a 60 minute infusion (but not more than 20 mg/min) with the same frequency as the oral products, although plasma concentration monitoring and dosage adjustments may be necessary.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In one clinical safety study, approximately 90 patients with epilepsy and with no measurable plasma levels of valproate were given single infusions of Depacon (up to 15 mg/kg and mean dose of 1184 mg) over 5-10 minutes (1.5-3.0 mg/kg/min).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients generally tolerated the more rapid infusions well.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This study was not designed to assess the effectiveness of these regimens.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For pharmacokinetics with rapid infusions, see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Initial Exposure to Valproate The following dosage recommendations were obtained from studies utilizing oral divalproex sodium products.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Complex Partial Seizures For adults and children 10 years of age or older.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Monotherapy (Initial Therapy) Depacon has not been systematically studied as initial therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients should initiate therapy at 10 to 15 mg/kg/day.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The dosage should be increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg/kg/day.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50 to 100 mcg/mL).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	No recommendation regarding the safety of valproate for use at doses above 60 mg/kg/day can be made.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The probability of thrombocytopenia increases significantly at total trough valproate plasma concentrations above 110 mcg/mL in females and 135 mcg/mL in males.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The benefit of improved seizure control with higher doses should be weighed against the possibility of a greater incidence of adverse reactions.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Conversion to Monotherapy Patients should initiate therapy at 10 to 15 mg/kg/day.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50-100 mcg/mL).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant antiepilepsy drug (AED) dosage can ordinarily be reduced by approximately 25% every 2 weeks.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This reduction may be started at initiation of Depacon therapy, or delayed by 1 to 2 weeks if there is a concern that seizures are likely to occur with a reduction.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The speed and duration of withdrawal of the concomitant AED can be highly variable, and patients should be monitored closely during this period for increased seizure frequency.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Adjunctive Therapy Depacon may be added to the patient's regimen at a dosage of 10 to 15 mg/kg/day.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The dosage may be increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If the total daily dose exceeds 250 mg, it should be given in divided doses.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a study of adjunctive therapy for complex partial seizures in which patients were receiving either carbamazepine or phenytoin in addition to valproate, no adjustment of carbamazepine or phenytoin dosage was needed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, since valproate may interact with these or other concurrently administered AEDs as well as other drugs, periodic plasma concentration determinations of concomitant AEDs are recommended during the early course of therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Simple and Complex Absence Seizures The recommended initial dose is 15 mg/kg/day, increasing at one week intervals by 5 to 10 mg/kg/day until seizures are controlled or side effects preclude further increases.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The maximum recommended dosage is 60 mg/kg/day.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A good correlation has not been established between daily dose, serum concentrations, and therapeutic effect.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, therapeutic valproate serum concentration for most patients with absence seizures is considered to range from 50 to 100 mcg/mL.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Some patients may be controlled with lower or higher serum concentrations.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	As the Depacon dosage is titrated upward, blood concentrations of phenobarbital and/or phenytoin may be affected.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Antiepilepsy drugs should not be abruptly discontinued in patients in whom the drug is administered to prevent major seizures because of the strong possibility of precipitating status epilepticus with attendant hypoxia and threat to life.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Replacement Therapy When switching from oral valproate products, the total daily dose of Depacon should be equivalent to the total daily dose of the oral valproate product, and should be administered as a 60 minute infusion (but not more than 20 mg/min) with the same frequency as the oral products, although plasma concentration monitoring and dosage adjustments may be necessary.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients receiving doses near the maximum recommended daily dose of 60 mg/kg/day, particularly those not receiving enzyme-inducing drugs, should be monitored more closely.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If the total daily dose exceeds 250 mg, it should be given in a divided regimen.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There is no experience with more rapid infusions in patients receiving Depacon as replacement therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, the equivalence shown between Depacon and oral valproate products (Depakote) at steady state was only evaluated in an every 6 hour regimen.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Whether, when Depacon is given less frequently (i.e., twice or three times a day), trough levels fall below those that result from an oral dosage form given via the same regimen, is unknown.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For this reason, when Depacon is given twice or three times a day, close monitoring of trough plasma levels may be needed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dosing in Elderly Patients Due to a decrease in unbound clearance of valproate and possibly a greater sensitivity to somnolence in the elderly, the starting dose should be reduced in these patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dosage should be increased more slowly and with regular monitoring for fluid and nutritional intake, dehydration, somnolence, and other adverse reactions.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dose reductions or discontinuation of valproate should be considered in patients with decreased food or fluid intake and in patients with excessive somnolence.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The ultimate therapeutic dose should be achieved on the basis of both tolerability and clinical response.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dose-Related Adverse Reactions The frequency of adverse effects (particularly elevated liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia) may be dose-related.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The probability of thrombocytopenia appears to increase significantly at total valproate concentrations of <U+2265> 110 mcg/mL (females) or <U+2265> 135 mcg/mL (males).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The benefit of improved therapeutic effect with higher doses should be weighed against the possibility of a greater incidence of adverse reactions.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Administration Rapid infusion of Depacon has been associated with an increase in adverse reactions.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There is limited experience with infusion times of less than 60 minutes or rates of infusion > 20 mg/min in patients with epilepsy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Depacon should be administered intravenously as a 60 minute infusion, as noted above.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It should be diluted with at least 50 mL of a compatible diluent.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Any unused portion of the vial contents should be discarded.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Compatibility and Stability Depacon was found to be physically compatible and chemically stable in the following parenteral solutions for at least 24 hours when stored in glass or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) bags at controlled room temperature 15-30<U+00B0>C (59-86<U+00B0>F). dextrose (5%) injection, USP sodium chloride (0.9%) injection, USP lactated ringer's injection, USP Patients stabilized on rufinamide before being prescribed valproate should begin valproate therapy at a low dose, and titrate to a clinically effective dose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore increased monitoring of valproate and concomitant drug concentrations and dosage adjustment are indicated whenever enzyme-inducing or inhibiting drugs are introduced or withdrawn (7.1) Aspirin, carbapenem antibiotics, estrogen-containing hormonal contraceptives: Monitoring of valproate concentrations is recommended (7.1) Co-administration of valproate can affect the pharmacokinetics of other drugs (e.g. diazepam, ethosuximide, lamotrigine, phenytoin) by inhibiting their metabolism or protein binding displacement (7.2) Patients stabilized on rufinamide should begin valproate therapy at a low dose, and titrate to clinically effective dose (7.2) Dosage adjustment of amitriptyline/nortriptyline, propofol, warfarin, and zidovudine may be necessary if used concomitantly with Depacon (7.2) Topiramate: Hyperammonemia and encephalopathy (5.9, 7.3) Drugs that affect the level of expression of hepatic enzymes, particularly those that elevate levels of glucuronosyltransferases (such as ritonavir), may increase the clearance of valproate.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In contrast, drugs that are inhibitors of cytochrome P450 isozymes, e.g., antidepressants, may be expected to have little effect on valproate clearance because cytochrome P450 microsomal mediated oxidation is a relatively minor secondary metabolic pathway compared to glucuronidation and beta-oxidation.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because of these changes in valproate clearance, monitoring of valproate and concomitant drug concentrations should be increased whenever enzyme inducing drugs are introduced or withdrawn.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The following list provides information about the potential for an influence of several commonly prescribed medications on valproate pharmacokinetics.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Alternative antibacterial or anticonvulsant therapy should be considered if serum valproic acid concentrations drop significantly or seizure control deteriorates.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Estrogen-Containing Hormonal Contraceptives Estrogen-containing hormonal contraceptives may increase the clearance of valproate, which may result in decreased concentration of valproate and potentially increased seizure frequency.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Prescribers should monitor serum valproate concentrations and clinical response when adding or discontinuing estrogen containing products.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Valproate dosage adjustment may be necessary when it is co-administered with rifampin.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drugs for which either no interaction or a likely clinically unimportant interaction has been observed Antacids A study involving the co-administration of valproate 500 mg with commonly administered antacids (Maalox, Trisogel, and Titralac - 160 mEq doses) did not reveal any effect on the extent of absorption of valproate.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Haloperidol A study involving the administration of 6 to 10 mg/day of haloperidol to schizophrenic patients already receiving valproate (200 mg BID) revealed no significant changes in valproate trough plasma levels.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cimetidine and Ranitidine Cimetidine and ranitidine do not affect the clearance of valproate.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Valproate has been found to be a weak inhibitor of some P450 isozymes, epoxide hydrase, and glucuronosyltransferases.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	See lamotrigine package insert for details on lamotrigine dosing with concomitant valproate administration.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There is evidence for severe CNS depression, with or without significant elevations of barbiturate or valproate serum concentrations.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	All patients receiving concomitant barbiturate therapy should be closely monitored for neurological toxicity.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Primidone, which is metabolized to a barbiturate, may be involved in a similar interaction with valproate.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In patients with epilepsy, there have been reports of breakthrough seizures occurring with the combination of valproate and phenytoin.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The dosage of phenytoin should be adjusted as required by the clinical situation.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Monitor patients closely for signs of increased sedation or cardiorespiratory depression.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The clinical relevance of this displacement is unknown.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The therapeutic relevance of this is unknown; however, coagulation tests should be monitored if valproate therapy is instituted in patients taking anticoagulants.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Oral Contraceptive Steroids Administration of a single-dose of ethinyloestradiol (50 mcg)/levonorgestrel (250 mcg) to 6 women on valproate (200 mg BID) therapy for 2 months did not reveal any pharmacokinetic interaction.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant administration of valproate and topiramate has been associated with hyperammonemia with and without encephalopathy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant administration of topiramate with valproate has also been associated with hypothermia in patients who have tolerated either drug alone.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It may be prudent to examine blood ammonia levels in patients in whom the onset of hypothermia has been reported.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hepatotoxicity; evaluate high risk populations and monitor serum liver tests (5.1) Birth defects and decreased IQ following in utero exposure; only use to treat pregnant women with epilepsy if other medications are unacceptable; should not be administered to a woman of childbearing potential unless essential (5.2, 5.3, 5.4) Pancreatitis; Depacon should ordinarily be discontinued (5.5) Bleeding and other hematopoietic disorders; monitor platelet counts and coagulation tests (5.7) Hyperammonemia and hyperammonemic encephalopathy; measure ammonia level if unexplained lethargy and vomiting or changes in mental status, and also with concomitant topiramate use; consider discontinuation of valproate therapy (5.6, 5.8, 5.9) Hypothermia; Hypothermia has been reported during valproate therapy with or without associated hyperammonemia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Depacon dosage should be increased slowly and with regular monitoring for fluid and nutritional intake (5.13) General Information on Hepatotoxicity Hepatic failure resulting in fatalities has occurred in patients receiving valproate.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Serum liver tests should be performed prior to therapy and at frequent intervals thereafter, especially during the first six months of valproate therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, healthcare providers should not rely totally on serum biochemistry since these tests may not be abnormal in all instances, but should also consider the results of careful interim medical history and physical examination.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Caution should be observed when administering valproate products to patients with a prior history of hepatic disease.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients on multiple anticonvulsants, children, those with congenital metabolic disorders, those with severe seizure disorders accompanied by mental retardation, and those with organic brain disease may be at particular risk.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	See below, <U+201C>Patients with Known or Suspected Mitochondrial Disease.<U+201D> Experience has indicated that children under the age of two years are at a considerably increased risk of developing fatal hepatotoxicity, especially those with the aforementioned conditions.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Use of Depacon has not been studied in children below the age of 2 years.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In progressively older patient groups experience in epilepsy has indicated that the incidence of fatal hepatotoxicity decreases considerably.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients with Known or Suspected Mitochondrial Disease Depacon is contraindicated in patients known to have mitochondrial disorders caused by POLG mutations and children under two years of age who are clinically suspected of having a mitochondrial disorder.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Valproate-induced acute liver failure and liver-related deaths have been reported in patients with hereditary neurometabolic syndromes caused by mutations in the gene for mitochondrial DNA polymerase <U+03B3> (POLG) (e.g., Alpers-Huttenlocher Syndrome) at a higher rate than those without these syndromes.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Most of the reported cases of liver failure in patients with these syndromes have been identified in children and adolescents.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	POLG-related disorders should be suspected in patients with a family history or suggestive symptoms of a POLG-related disorder, including but not limited to unexplained encephalopathy, refractory epilepsy (focal, myoclonic), status epilepticus at presentation, developmental delays, psychomotor regression, axonal sensorimotor neuropathy, myopathy cerebellar ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, or complicated migraine with occipital aura.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	POLG mutation testing should be performed in accordance with current clinical practice for the diagnostic evaluation of such disorders.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The A467T and W748S mutations are present in approximately 2/3 of patients with autosomal recessive POLG-related disorders.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This older group of patients should be closely monitored during treatment with Depacon for the development of acute liver injury with regular clinical assessments and serum liver test monitoring.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The drug should be discontinued immediately in the presence of significant hepatic dysfunction, suspected or apparent.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In some cases, hepatic dysfunction has progressed in spite of discontinuation of drug.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Valproate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Pregnancy registry data show that maternal valproate use can cause neural tube defects and other structural abnormalities (e.g., craniofacial defects, cardiovascular malformations, hypospadias, limb malformations).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The rate of congenital malformations among babies born to mothers using valproate is about four times higher than the rate among babies born to epileptic mothers using other anti-seizure monotherapies.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Evidence suggests that folic acid supplementation prior to conception and during the first trimester of pregnancy decreases the risk for congenital neural tube defects in the general population.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Valproate can cause decreased IQ scores following in utero exposure.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Published epidemiological studies have indicated that children exposed to valproate in utero have lower cognitive test scores than children exposed in utero to either another antiepileptic drug or to no antiepileptic drugs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The largest of these studies1 is a prospective cohort study conducted in the United States and United Kingdom that found that children with prenatal exposure to valproate (n=62) had lower IQ scores at age 6 (97 [95% C.I.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	94-101]) than children with prenatal exposure to the other antiepileptic drug monotherapy treatments evaluated: lamotrigine (108 [95% C.I.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is not known when during pregnancy cognitive effects in valproate-exposed children occur.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because the women in this study were exposed to antiepileptic drugs throughout pregnancy, whether the risk for decreased IQ was related to a particular time period during pregnancy could not be assessed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Although all of the available studies have methodological limitations, the weight of the evidence supports the conclusion that valproate exposure in utero can cause decreased IQ in children.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In animal studies, offspring with prenatal exposure to valproate had malformations similar to those seen in humans and demonstrated neurobehavioral deficits.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Women with epilepsy who are pregnant or who plan to become pregnant should not be treated with valproate unless other treatments have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In such women, the benefits of treatment with valproate during pregnancy may still outweigh the risks.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because of the risk to the fetus of decreased IQ and major congenital malformations (including neural tube defects), which may occur very early in pregnancy, valproate should not be administered to a woman of childbearing potential unless the drug is essential to the management of her medical condition.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Women who are planning a pregnancy should be counseled regarding the relative risks and benefits of valproate use during pregnancy, and alternative therapeutic options should be considered for these patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	To prevent major seizures, valproate should not be discontinued abruptly, as this can precipitate status epilepticus with resulting maternal and fetal hypoxia and threat to life.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is not known whether the risk of neural tube defects or decreased IQ in the offspring of women receiving valproate is reduced by folic acid supplementation.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dietary folic acid supplementation both prior to conception and during pregnancy should be routinely recommended for patients using valproate.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cases of life-threatening pancreatitis have been reported in both children and adults receiving valproate.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Some of the cases have been described as hemorrhagic with rapid progression from initial symptoms to death.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Some cases have occurred shortly after initial use as well as after several years of use.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The rate based upon the reported cases exceeds that expected in the general population and there have been cases in which pancreatitis recurred after rechallenge with valproate.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In clinical trials, there were 2 cases of pancreatitis without alternative etiology in 2416 patients, representing 1044 patient-years experience.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If pancreatitis is diagnosed, Depacon should ordinarily be discontinued.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Depacon is contraindicated in patients with known urea cycle disorders (UCD).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hyperammonemic encephalopathy, sometimes fatal, has been reported following initiation of valproate therapy in patients with urea cycle disorders, a group of uncommon genetic abnormalities, particularly ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Prior to the initiation of Depacon therapy, evaluation for UCD should be considered in the following patients: 1) those with a history of unexplained encephalopathy or coma, encephalopathy associated with a protein load, pregnancy-related or postpartum encephalopathy, unexplained mental retardation, or history of elevated plasma ammonia or glutamine; 2) those with cyclical vomiting and lethargy, episodic extreme irritability, ataxia, low BUN, or protein avoidance; 3) those with a family history of UCD or a family history of unexplained infant deaths (particularly males); 4) those with other signs or symptoms of UCD.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients who develop symptoms of unexplained hyperammonemic encephalopathy while receiving valproate therapy should receive prompt treatment (including discontinuation of valproate therapy) and be evaluated for underlying urea cycle disorders.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Valproate is associated with dose-related thrombocytopenia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a clinical trial of Depakote (divalproex sodium) as monotherapy in patients with epilepsy, 34/126 patients (27%) receiving approximately 50 mg/kg/day on average, had at least one value of platelets <U+2264> 75 x 109/L.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Approximately half of these patients had treatment discontinued, with return of platelet counts to normal.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In the remaining patients, platelet counts normalized with continued treatment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In this study, the probability of thrombocytopenia appeared to increase significantly at total valproate concentrations of <U+2265> 110 mcg/mL (females) or <U+2265> 135 mcg/mL (males).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The therapeutic benefit which may accompany the higher doses should therefore be weighed against the possibility of a greater incidence of adverse effects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Valproate use has also been associated with decreases in other cell lines and myelodysplasia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because of reports of cytopenias, inhibition of the secondary phase of platelet aggregation, and abnormal coagulation parameters (e.g., low fibrinogen, coagulation factor deficiencies, acquired von Willebrand<U+2019>s disease), measurements of complete blood counts and coagulation tests are recommended before initiating therapy and at periodic intervals.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is recommended that patients receiving Depacon be monitored for blood counts and coagulation parameters prior to planned surgery and during pregnancy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Evidence of hemorrhage, bruising, or a disorder of hemostasis/coagulation is an indication for reduction of the dosage or withdrawal of therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hyperammonemia has been reported in association with valproate therapy and may be present despite normal liver function tests.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In patients who develop unexplained lethargy and vomiting or changes in mental status, hyperammonemic encephalopathy should be considered and an ammonia level should be measured.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hyperammonemia should also be considered in patients who present with hypothermia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If ammonia is increased, valproate therapy should be discontinued.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Appropriate interventions for treatment of hyperammonemia should be initiated, and such patients should undergo investigation for underlying urea cycle disorders.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Asymptomatic elevations of ammonia are more common and when present, require close monitoring of plasma ammonia levels.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If the elevation persists, discontinuation of valproate therapy should be considered.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant administration of topiramate and valproate has been associated with hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy in patients who have tolerated either drug alone.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Clinical symptoms of hyperammonemic encephalopathy often include acute alterations in level of consciousness and/or cognitive function with lethargy or vomiting.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hypothermia can also be a manifestation of hyperammonemia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In most cases, symptoms and signs abated with discontinuation of either drug.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This adverse reaction is not due to a pharmacokinetic interaction.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients with inborn errors of metabolism or reduced hepatic mitochondrial activity may be at an increased risk for hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Although not studied, an interaction of topiramate and valproate may exacerbate existing defects or unmask deficiencies in susceptible persons.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In patients who develop unexplained lethargy, vomiting, or changes in mental status, hyperammonemic encephalopathy should be considered and an ammonia level should be measured.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hypothermia, defined as an unintentional drop in body core temperature to <35<U+00B0>C (95<U+00B0>F), has been reported in association with valproate therapy both in conjunction with and in the absence of hyperammonemia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This adverse reaction can also occur in patients using concomitant topiramate with valproate after starting topiramate treatment or after increasing the daily dose of topiramate.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Consideration should be given to stopping valproate in patients who develop hypothermia, which may be manifested by a variety of clinical abnormalities including lethargy, confusion, coma, and significant alterations in other major organ systems such as the cardiovascular and respiratory systems.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Clinical management and assessment should include examination of blood ammonia levels.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan Hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking valproate.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, and/or lymphadenopathy, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Valproate should be discontinued and not be resumed if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Carbapenem antibiotics (for example, ertapenem, imipenem, meropenem; this is not a complete list) may reduce serum valproate concentrations to subtherapeutic levels, resulting in loss of seizure control.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Serum valproate concentrations should be monitored frequently after initiating carbapenem therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Alternative antibacterial or anticonvulsant therapy should be considered if serum valproate concentrations drop significantly or seizure control deteriorates.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a double-blind, multicenter trial of valproate in elderly patients with dementia (mean age = 83 years), doses were increased by 125 mg/day to a target dose of 20 mg/kg/day.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A significantly higher proportion of valproate patients had somnolence compared to placebo, and although not statistically significant, there was a higher proportion of patients with dehydration.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Discontinuations for somnolence were also significantly higher than with placebo.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In some patients with somnolence (approximately one-half), there was associated reduced nutritional intake and weight loss.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There was a trend for the patients who experienced these events to have a lower baseline albumin concentration, lower valproate clearance, and a higher BUN.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In elderly patients, dosage should be increased more slowly and with regular monitoring for fluid and nutritional intake, dehydration, somnolence, and other adverse reactions.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of IV valproate in the prevention of post-traumatic seizures in patients with acute head injuries.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients were randomly assigned to receive either IV valproate given for one week (followed by oral valproate products for either one or six months per random treatment assignment) or IV phenytoin given for one week (followed by placebo).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In this study, the incidence of death was found to be higher in the two groups assigned to valproate treatment compared to the rate in those assigned to the IV phenytoin treatment group (13% vs. 8.5%, respectively).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Many of these patients were critically ill with multiple and/or severe injuries, and evaluation of the causes of death did not suggest any specific drug-related causation.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Further, in the absence of a concurrent placebo control during the initial week of intravenous therapy, it is impossible to determine if the mortality rate in the patients treated with valproate was greater or less than that expected in a similar group not treated with valproate, or whether the rate seen in the IV phenytoin treated patients was lower than would be expected.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Nonetheless, until further information is available, it seems prudent not to use Depacon in patients with acute head trauma for the prophylaxis of post-traumatic seizures.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Since valproate may interact with concurrently administered drugs which are capable of enzyme induction, periodic plasma concentration determinations of valproate and concomitant drugs are recommended during the early course of therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Valproate is partially eliminated in the urine as a keto-metabolite which may lead to a false interpretation of the urine ketone test.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There have been reports of altered thyroid function tests associated with valproate.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The clinical significance of these is unknown.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There are in vitro studies that suggest valproate stimulates the replication of the HIV and CMV viruses under certain experimental conditions.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The clinical consequence, if any, is not known.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Additionally, the relevance of these in vitro findings is uncertain for patients receiving maximally suppressive antiretroviral therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Nevertheless, these data should be borne in mind when interpreting the results from regular monitoring of the viral load in HIV infected patients receiving valproate or when following CMV infected patients clinically.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Depacon exists as the valproate ion in the blood.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The mechanisms by which valproate exerts its therapeutic effects have not been established.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It has been suggested that its activity in epilepsy is related to increased brain concentrations of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The relationship between plasma concentration and clinical response is not well documented.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	One contributing factor is the nonlinear, concentration dependent protein binding of valproate which affects the clearance of the drug.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thus, monitoring of total serum valproate cannot provide a reliable index of the bioactive valproate species.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For example, because the plasma protein binding of valproate is concentration dependent, the free fraction increases from approximately 10% at 40 mcg/mL to 18.5% at 130 mcg/mL.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Higher than expected free fractions occur in the elderly, in hyperlipidemic patients, and in patients with hepatic and renal diseases.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Epilepsy The therapeutic range in epilepsy is commonly considered to be 50 to 100 mcg/mL of total valproate, although some patients may be controlled with lower or higher plasma concentrations.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Equivalent doses of Depacon and Depakote (divalproex sodium) yield equivalent plasma levels of the valproate ion.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Bioavailability Equivalent doses of intravenous (IV) valproate and oral valproate products are expected to result in equivalent Cmax, Cmin, and total systemic exposure to the valproate ion when the IV valproate is administered as a 60 minute infusion.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, the rate of valproate ion absorption may vary with the formulation used.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These differences should be of minor clinical importance under the steady state conditions achieved in chronic use in the treatment of epilepsy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Administration of Depakote (divalproex sodium) tablets and IV valproate (given as a one hour infusion), 250 mg every 6 hours for 4 days to 18 healthy male volunteers resulted in equivalent AUC, Cmax, Cmin at steady state, as well as after the first dose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The Tmax after IV Depacon occurs at the end of the one hour infusion, while the Tmax after oral dosing with Depakote occurs at approximately 4 hours.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because the kinetics of unbound valproate are linear, bioequivalence between Depacon and Depakote up to the maximum recommended dose of 60 mg/kg/day can be assumed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The AUC and Cmax resulting from administration of IV valproate 500 mg as a single one hour infusion and a single 500 mg dose of Depakene syrup to 17 healthy male volunteers were also equivalent.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients maintained on valproic acid doses of 750 mg to 4250 mg daily (given in divided doses every 6 hours) as oral Depakote (divalproex sodium) alone (n = 24) or with another stabilized antiepileptic drug [carbamazepine (n = 15), phenytoin (n = 11), or phenobarbital (n = 1)], showed comparable plasma levels for valproic acid when switching from oral Depakote to IV valproate (1-hour infusion).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Eleven healthy volunteers were given single infusions of 1000 mg IV valproate over 5, 10, 30, and 60 minutes in a 4-period crossover study.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Total valproate concentrations were measured; unbound concentrations were not measured.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	After the 5 minute infusions (mean rate of 2.8 mg/kg/min), mean Cmax was 145 <U+00B1> 32 mcg/mL, while after the 60 minute infusions, mean Cmax was 115 <U+00B1> 8 mcg/mL.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Ninety to 120 minutes after infusion initiation, total valproate concentrations were similar for all 4 rates of infusion.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because protein binding is nonlinear at higher total valproate concentrations, the corresponding increase in unbound Cmax at faster infusion rates will be greater.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Distribution Protein Binding The plasma protein binding of valproate is concentration dependent and the free fraction increases from approximately 10% at 40 mcg/mL to 18.5% at 130 mcg/mL.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CNS Distribution Valproate concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) approximate unbound concentrations in plasma (about 10% of total concentration).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Metabolism Valproate is metabolized almost entirely by the liver.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In adult patients on monotherapy, 30-50% of an administered dose appears in urine as a glucuronide conjugate.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Mitochondrial <U+03B2>-oxidation is the other major metabolic pathway, typically accounting for over 40% of the dose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Usually, less than 15-20% of the dose is eliminated by other oxidative mechanisms.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Less than 3% of an administered dose is excreted unchanged in urine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The relationship between dose and total valproate concentration is nonlinear; concentration does not increase proportionally with the dose, but rather, increases to a lesser extent due to saturable plasma protein binding.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Elimination Mean plasma clearance and volume of distribution for total valproate are 0.56 L/hr/1.73 m2 and 11 L/1.73 m2, respectively.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Mean terminal half-life for valproate monotherapy after an intravenous infusion of 1,000 mg was 16 <U+00B1> 3.0 hours.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The estimates cited apply primarily to patients who are not taking drugs that affect hepatic metabolizing enzyme systems.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because of these changes in valproate clearance, monitoring of antiepileptic concentrations should be intensified whenever concomitant antiepileptics are introduced or withdrawn.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Special Populations Effect of Age Neonates Children within the first two months of life have a markedly decreased ability to eliminate valproate compared to older children and adults.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This is a result of reduced clearance (perhaps due to delay in development of glucuronosyltransferase and other enzyme systems involved in valproate elimination) as well as increased volume of distribution (in part due to decreased plasma protein binding).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For example, in one study, the half-life in children under 10 days ranged from 10 to 67 hours compared to a range of 7 to 13 hours in children greater than 2 months.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Children Pediatric patients (i.e., between 3 months and 10 years) have 50% higher clearances expressed on weight (i.e., mL/min/kg) than do adults.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Over the age of 10 years, children have pharmacokinetic parameters that approximate those of adults.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Elderly The capacity of elderly patients (age range: 68 to 89 years) to eliminate valproate has been shown to be reduced compared to younger adults (age range: 22 to 26 years).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Intrinsic clearance is reduced by 39%; the free fraction is increased by 44%.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Accordingly, the initial dosage should be reduced in the elderly.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effect of Sex There are no differences in the body surface area adjusted unbound clearance between males and females (4.8 <U+00B1> 0.17 and 4.7 <U+00B1> 0.07 L/hr per 1.73 m2, respectively).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effect of Race The effects of race on the kinetics of valproate have not been studied.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effect of Disease Liver Disease Liver disease impairs the capacity to eliminate valproate.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In one study, the clearance of free valproate was decreased by 50% in 7 patients with cirrhosis and by 16% in 4 patients with acute hepatitis, compared with 6 healthy subjects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In that study, the half-life of valproate was increased from 12 to 18 hours.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Liver disease is also associated with decreased albumin concentrations and larger unbound fractions (2 to 2.6 fold increase) of valproate.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Accordingly, monitoring of total concentrations may be misleading since free concentrations may be substantially elevated in patients with hepatic disease whereas total concentrations may appear to be normal.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Renal Disease A slight reduction (27%) in the unbound clearance of valproate has been reported in patients with renal failure (creatinine clearance < 10 mL/minute); however, hemodialysis typically reduces valproate concentrations by about 20%.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, no dosage adjustment appears to be necessary in patients with renal failure.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Protein binding in these patients is substantially reduced; thus, monitoring total concentrations may be misleading.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	ALBENZA is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the benzimidazole class of compounds or any components of ALBENZA.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Immediately discontinue ALBENZA if a patient becomes pregnant and apprise the patient of the potential hazard to the fetus.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients being treated for neurocysticercosis should receive steroid and anticonvulsant therapy to prevent neurological symptoms (e.g. seizures, increased intracranial pressure and focal signs) as a result of an inflammatory reaction caused by death of the parasite within the brain.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Before initiating therapy for neurocysticercosis, examine the patient for the presence of retinal lesions.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If such lesions are visualized, weigh the need for anticysticeral therapy against the possibility of retinal damage resulting from inflammatory damage caused by ALBENZA-induced death of the parasite.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In clinical trials, treatment with ALBENZA has been associated with mild to moderate elevations of hepatic enzymes in approximately 16% of patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These elevations have generally returned to normal upon discontinuation of therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There have also been case reports of acute liver failure of uncertain causality and hepatitis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Monitor liver enzymes (transaminases) before the start of each treatment cycle and at least every 2 weeks during treatment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If hepatic enzymes exceed twice the upper limit of normal, consideration should be given to discontinuing ALBENZA therapy based on individual patient circumstances.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Restarting ALBENZA treatment in patients whose hepatic enzymes have normalized off treatment is an individual decision that should take into account the risk/benefit of further ALBENZA usage.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Undiagnosed neurocysticercosis may be uncovered in patients treated with ALBENZA for other conditions.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients with epidemiologic factors who are at risk for neurocysticercosis should be evaluated prior to initiation of therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	ALBENZA (albendazole) is a synthetic, antihelminthic drug of the class benzimidazole.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Absorption Albendazole is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract due to its low aqueous solubility.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Albendazole concentrations are negligible or undetectable in plasma as it is rapidly converted to the sulfoxide metabolite prior to reaching the systemic circulation.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The systemic anthelmintic activity has been attributed to the primary metabolite, albendazole sulfoxide.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Maximal plasma concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide were achieved 2 hours to 5 hours after dosing and were on average 1310 ng/mL (range 460 ng/mL to 1580 ng/mL) following oral doses of albendazole (400 mg) in 6 hydatid disease patients, when administered with a fatty meal.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Plasma concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide increased in a dose-proportional manner over the therapeutic dose range following ingestion of a high-fat meal (fat content 43.1 grams).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The mean apparent terminal elimination half-life of albendazole sulfoxide ranged from 8 hours to 12 hours in 25 healthy subjects, as well as in 14 hydatid and 8 neurocysticercosis patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Following 4 weeks of treatment with albendazole (200 mg three times daily), 12 patients<U+2019> plasma concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide were approximately 20% lower than those observed during the first half of the treatment period, suggesting that albendazole may induce its own metabolism.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Distribution Albendazole sulfoxide is 70% bound to plasma protein and is widely distributed throughout the body; it has been detected in urine, bile, liver, cyst wall, cyst fluid, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concentrations in plasma were 3-fold to 10-fold and 2-fold to 4-fold higher than those simultaneously determined in cyst fluid and CSF, respectively.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Metabolism and Excretion Albendazole is rapidly converted in the liver to the primary metabolite, albendazole sulfoxide, which is further metabolized to albendazole sulfone and other primary oxidative metabolites that have been identified in human urine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Following oral administration, albendazole has not been detected in human urine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Urinary excretion of albendazole sulfoxide is a minor elimination pathway with less than 1% of the dose recovered in the urine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Biliary elimination presumably accounts for a portion of the elimination as evidenced by biliary concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide similar to those achieved in plasma.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Specific Populations Pediatrics Following single-dose administration of 200 mg to 300 mg (approximately 10 mg/kg) ALBENZA to 3 fasted and 2 fed pediatric patients with hydatid cyst disease (age range 6 to 13 years), albendazole sulfoxide pharmacokinetics were similar to those observed in fed adults.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Geriatrics Although no studies have investigated the effect of age on albendazole sulfoxide pharmacokinetics, data in 26 hydatid cyst patients (up to 79 years) suggest pharmacokinetics similar to those in young healthy subjects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Mechanism of Action ALBENZA binds to the colchicine-sensitive site of <U+03B2>-tubulin inhibiting their polymerization into microtubules.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The decrease in microtubules in the intestinal cells of the parasites decreases their absorptive function, especially the uptake of glucose by the adult and larval forms of the parasites, and also depletes glycogen storage.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Insufficient glucose results in insufficient energy for the production of adenosine trisphosphate (ATP) and the parasite eventually dies.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Mechanism of Resistance Parasitic resistance to albendazole is caused by changes in amino acids that result in changes in the <U+03B2>-tubulin protein.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This causes reduced binding of the drug to <U+03B2>-tubulin.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In the specified treatment indications albendazole appears to be active against the larval forms of the following organisms: Echinococcus granulosus Taenia solium	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	CONTRAVE contains bupropion, a dopamine and norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitor that is similar to some drugs used for the treatment of depression; therefore, the following precautions pertaining to these products should be considered when treating patients with CONTRAVE.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients with major depressive disorder, both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There has been a long-standing concern that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In placebo-controlled clinical trials with CONTRAVE for the treatment of obesity in adult patients, no suicides or suicide attempts were reported in studies up to 56 weeks duration with CONTRAVE (equivalent to bupropion doses of 360 mg/day).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In these same studies, suicidal ideation was reported by 3 (0.20%) of 1,515 patients treated with placebo compared with 1 (0.03%) of 3,239 treated with CONTRAVE.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors [SSRIs] and others) show that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18 to 24) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Short-term clinical trials did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared with placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared with placebo in adults aged 65 and older.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of nine antidepressant drugs in over 4,400 patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of two months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The risk differences (drug vs placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1,000 patients treated) are provided in Table 2.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Risk Differences in the Number of Suicidality Cases by Age Group in the Pooled Placebo-Controlled Trials of Antidepressants in Pediatric and Adult Subjects Age Range Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Cases of Suicidality per 1,000 Patients Treated Increases Compared to Placebo <18 14 additional cases 18 to 24 5 additional cases Decreases Compared to Placebo 25 to 64 1 fewer case <U+2265>65 6 fewer cases No suicides occurred in any of the antidepressant pediatric trials.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There were suicides in the adult antidepressant trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This warning applies to CONTRAVE because one of its components, bupropion, is a member of an antidepressant class.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient<U+2019>s presenting symptoms.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of anxiety, agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to healthcare providers.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Prescriptions for CONTRAVE should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CONTRAVE is not approved for smoking cessation treatment, but serious neuropsychiatric symptoms have been reported in patients taking bupropion for smoking cessation.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These have included changes in mood (including depression and mania), psychosis, hallucinations, paranoia, delusions, homicidal ideation, hostility, agitation, aggression, anxiety, and panic, as well as suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and completed suicide.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Observe patients for the occurrence of neuropsychiatric reactions.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Instruct patients to contact a healthcare professional if such reactions occur.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In many of these cases, a causal relationship to bupropion treatment is not certain, because depressed mood can be a symptom of nicotine withdrawal.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Depression, suicide, attempted suicide and suicidal ideation have been reported in the postmarketing experience with naltrexone used in the treatment of opioid dependence.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	No causal relationship has been demonstrated.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Bupropion, a component of CONTRAVE, can cause seizures.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The incidence of seizure in patients receiving CONTRAVE in clinical trials was approximately 0.1% vs 0% on placebo.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CONTRAVE should be discontinued and not restarted in patients who experience a seizure while being treated with CONTRAVE.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The risk of seizures is also related to patient factors, clinical situations, and concomitant medications that lower the seizure threshold.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Consider these risks before initiating treatment with CONTRAVE.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CONTRAVE is contraindicated in patients with a seizure disorder, current or prior diagnosis of anorexia nervosa or bulimia, or undergoing abrupt discontinuation of alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and antiepileptic drugs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Caution should be used when prescribing CONTRAVE to patients with predisposing factors that may increase the risk of seizure including: history of head trauma or prior seizure, severe stroke, arteriovenous malformation, central nervous system tumor or infection, or metabolic disorders (e.g., hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, severe hepatic impairment, and hypoxia) excessive use of alcohol or sedatives, addiction to cocaine or stimulants, or withdrawal from sedatives patients with diabetes treated with insulin and/or oral diabetic medications (sulfonylureas and meglitinides) that may cause hypoglycemia concomitant administration of medications that may lower the seizure threshold, including other bupropion products, antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, theophylline, systemic steroids Recommendations for Reducing the Risk of Seizure: Clinical experience with bupropion suggests that the risk of seizure may be minimized by adhering to the recommended dosing recommendations, in particular: the total daily dose of CONTRAVE does not exceed 360 mg of the bupropion component (i.e., four tablets per day) the daily dose is administered in divided doses (twice daily) the dose is escalated gradually no more than two tablets are taken at one time coadministration of CONTRAVE with high-fat meals is avoided if a dose is missed, a patient should wait until the next scheduled dose to resume the regular dosing schedule Vulnerability to Opioid Overdose: CONTRAVE should not be administered to patients receiving chronic opioids, due to the naltrexone component, which is an opioid receptor antagonist.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If chronic opiate therapy is required, CONTRAVE treatment should be stopped.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In patients requiring intermittent opiate treatment, CONTRAVE therapy should be temporarily discontinued and lower doses of opioids may be needed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients should be alerted that they may be more sensitive to opioids, even at lower doses, after CONTRAVE treatment is discontinued.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An attempt by a patient to overcome any naltrexone opioid blockade by administering large amounts of exogenous opioids is especially dangerous and may lead to a fatal overdose or life-threatening opioid intoxication (e.g., respiratory arrest, circulatory collapse).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients should be told of the serious consequences of trying to overcome the opioid blockade.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Precipitated Opioid Withdrawal: The symptoms of spontaneous opioid withdrawal, which are associated with the discontinuation of opioid in a dependent individual, are uncomfortable, but they are not generally believed to be severe or necessitate hospitalization.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, when withdrawal is precipitated abruptly, the resulting withdrawal syndrome can be severe enough to require hospitalization.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	To prevent occurrence of either precipitated withdrawal in patients dependent on opioids or exacerbation of a pre-existing subclinical withdrawal symptoms, opioid-dependent patients, including those being treated for alcohol dependence, should be opioid-free (including tramadol) before starting CONTRAVE treatment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An opioid-free interval of a minimum of 7 to 10 days is recommended for patients previously dependent on short-acting opioids, and those patients transitioning from buprenorphine or methadone may need as long as two weeks.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients should be made aware of the risks associated with precipitated withdrawal and encouraged to give an accurate account of last opioid use.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CONTRAVE can cause an increase in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure as well as an increase in resting heart rate.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In clinical practice with other bupropion-containing products, hypertension, in some cases severe and requiring acute treatment, has been reported.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The clinical significance of the increases in blood pressure and heart rate observed with CONTRAVE treatment is unclear, especially for patients with cardiac and cerebrovascular disease, since patients with a history of myocardial infarction or stroke in the previous 6 months, life-threatening arrhythmias, or congestive heart failure were excluded from CONTRAVE clinical trials.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Blood pressure and pulse should be measured prior to starting therapy with CONTRAVE and should be monitored at regular intervals consistent with usual clinical practice, particularly among patients with controlled hypertension prior to treatment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CONTRAVE should not be given to patients with uncontrolled hypertension.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Among patients treated with CONTRAVE in placebo-controlled clinical trials, mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure was approximately 1 mmHg higher than baseline at Weeks 4 and 8, similar to baseline at Week 12, and approximately 1 mmHg below baseline between Weeks 24 and 56.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In contrast, among patients treated with placebo, mean blood pressure was approximately 2 to 3 mmHg below baseline throughout the same time points, yielding statistically significant differences between the groups at every assessment during this period.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The largest mean differences between the groups were observed during the first 12 weeks (treatment difference +1.8 to +2.4 mmHg systolic, all p<0.001; +1.7 to +2.1 mmHg diastolic, all p<0.001).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For heart rate, at both Weeks 4 and 8, mean heart rate was statistically significantly higher (2.1 bpm) in the CONTRAVE group compared with the placebo group; at Week 52, the difference between groups was +1.7 bpm (p<0.001).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In an ambulatory blood pressure monitoring substudy of 182 patients, the mean change from baseline in systolic blood pressure after 52 weeks of treatment was -0.2 mmHg for the CONTRAVE group and -2.8 mmHg for the placebo group (treatment difference, +2.6 mmHg, p=0.08); the mean change in diastolic blood pressure was +0.8 mmHg for the CONTRAVE group and -2.1 mmHg for the placebo group (treatment difference, +2.9 mmHg, p=0.004).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A greater percentage of subjects had adverse reactions related to blood pressure or heart rate in the CONTRAVE group compared to the placebo group (6.3% vs 4.2%, respectively), primarily attributable to adverse reactions of Hypertension/Blood Pressure Increased (5.9% vs 4.0%, respectively).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These events were observed in both patients with and without evidence of preexisting hypertension.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a trial that enrolled individuals with diabetes, 12.0% of patients in the CONTRAVE group and 6.5% in the placebo group had a blood pressure-related adverse reaction.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Anaphylactoid/anaphylactic reactions characterized by symptoms such as pruritus, urticaria, angioedema, and dyspnea requiring medical treatment have been reported in clinical trials with bupropion.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In addition, there have been rare spontaneous postmarketing reports of erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and anaphylactic shock associated with bupropion.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Instruct patients to discontinue CONTRAVE and consult a healthcare provider if they develop an allergic or anaphylactoid/anaphylactic reaction (e.g., skin rash, pruritus, hives, chest pain, edema, or shortness of breath) during treatment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Arthralgia, myalgia, fever with rash, and other symptoms suggestive of delayed hypersensitivity have been reported in association with bupropion.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These symptoms may resemble serum sickness.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cases of hepatitis and clinically significant liver dysfunction were observed in association with naltrexone exposure during naltrexone clinical trials and in postmarketing reports for patients using naltrexone.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Transient, asymptomatic hepatic transaminase elevations were also observed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When patients presented with elevated transaminases, there were often other potential causative or contributory etiologies identified, including pre-existing alcoholic liver disease, hepatitis B and/or C infection, and concomitant usage of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Although clinically significant liver dysfunction is not typically recognized as a manifestation of opioid withdrawal, opioid withdrawal that is precipitated abruptly may lead to systemic sequelae, including acute liver injury.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients should be warned of the risk of hepatic injury and advised to seek medical attention if they experience symptoms of acute hepatitis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Use of CONTRAVE should be discontinued in the event of symptoms and/or signs of acute hepatitis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In CONTRAVE clinical trials, there were no cases of elevated transaminases greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) in conjunction with an increase in bilirubin greater than two times ULN.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Bupropion, a component of CONTRAVE, is a drug used for the treatment of depression.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Antidepressant treatment can precipitate a manic, mixed, or hypomanic episode.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The risk appears to be increased in patients with bipolar disorder or who have risk factors for bipolar disorder.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Prior to initiating CONTRAVE, screen patients for a history of bipolar disorder and the presence of risk factors for bipolar disorder (e.g., family history of bipolar disorder, suicide, or depression).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CONTRAVE is not approved for use in treating bipolar depression.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	No activation of mania or hypomania was reported in the clinical trials evaluating effects of CONTRAVE in obese patients; however, patients receiving antidepressant medications and patients with a history of bipolar disorder or recent hospitalization because of psychiatric illness were excluded from CONTRAVE clinical trials.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs including bupropion, a component of CONTRAVE, may trigger an angle-closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Weight loss may increase the risk of hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with insulin and/or insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylureas).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Measurement of blood glucose levels prior to starting CONTRAVE and during CONTRAVE treatment is recommended in patients with type 2 diabetes.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Decreases in medication doses for antidiabetic medications which are non-glucose-dependent should be considered to mitigate the risk of hypoglycemia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If a patient develops hypoglycemia after starting CONTRAVE, appropriate changes should be made to the antidiabetic drug regimen.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CONTRAVE has two components: naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, and bupropion, a relatively weak inhibitor of the neuronal reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Nonclinical studies suggest that naltrexone and bupropion have effects on two separate areas of the brain involved in the regulation of food intake: the hypothalamus (appetite regulatory center) and the mesolimbic dopamine circuit (reward system).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The exact neurochemical effects of CONTRAVE leading to weight loss are not fully understood.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Combined, bupropion and naltrexone increased the firing rate of hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in vitro, which are associated with regulation of appetite.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The combination of bupropion and naltrexone also reduced food intake when injected directly into the ventral tegmental area of the mesolimbic circuit in mice, an area associated with regulation of reward pathways.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Absorption Naltrexone Following single oral administration of CONTRAVE (two 8 mg naltrexone/90 mg bupropion tablets) to healthy subjects, mean peak naltrexone concentration (Cmax) was 1.4 ng/mL, time to peak concentration (Tmax) was 2 hours, and extent of exposure (AUC0-inf) was 8.4 ng<U+2219>hr/mL.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Bupropion Following single oral administration of CONTRAVE (two 8 mg naltrexone/90 mg bupropion tablets) to healthy subjects, mean peak bupropion concentration (Cmax) was 168 ng/mL, time to peak concentration (Tmax) was three hours, and extent of exposure (AUC0-inf) was 1,607 ng<U+2219>hr/mL.

5	Bupropion Bupropion is 84% plasma protein bound.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The mean apparent volume of distribution at steady state for bupropion (Vss/F) is 880 liters.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Metabolism and Excretion Naltrexone The major metabolite of naltrexone is 6-beta-naltrexol.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The activity of naltrexone is believed to be the result of both the parent and the 6-beta-naltrexol metabolite.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Though less potent, 6-beta-naltrexol is eliminated more slowly and thus circulates at much higher concentrations than naltrexone.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Naltrexone and 6-beta-naltrexol are not metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes and in vitro studies indicate that there is no potential for inhibition or induction of important isozymes.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Naltrexone and its metabolites are excreted primarily by the kidney (53% to 79% of the dose).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Urinary excretion of unchanged naltrexone accounts for less than 2% of an oral dose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Urinary excretion of unchanged and conjugated 6-beta-naltrexol accounts for 43% of an oral dose.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The renal clearance for naltrexone ranges from 30 to 127 mL/min, suggesting that renal elimination is primarily by glomerular filtration.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The renal clearance for 6-beta-naltrexol ranges from 230 to 369 mL/min suggesting an additional renal tubular secretory mechanism.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Fecal excretion is a minor elimination pathway.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Following single oral administration of CONTRAVE tablets to healthy subjects, mean elimination half-life (T1/2) was approximately 5 hours for naltrexone.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Following twice daily administration of CONTRAVE, naltrexone did not accumulate and its kinetics appeared linear.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, in comparison to naltrexone, 6-beta-naltrexol accumulates to a larger extent (accumulation ratio ~3).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Bupropion Bupropion is extensively metabolized with three active metabolites: hydroxybupropion, threohydrobupropion and erythrohydrobupropion.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The metabolites have longer elimination half-lives than bupropion and accumulate to a greater extent.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Following bupropion administration, more than 90% of the exposure is a result of metabolites.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In vitro findings suggest that CYP2B6 is the principal isozyme involved in the formation of hydroxybupropion whereas cytochrome P450 isozymes are not involved in the formation of the other active metabolites.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Bupropion and its metabolites inhibit CYP2D6.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Plasma protein binding of hydroxybupropion is similar to that of bupropion (84%) whereas the other two metabolites have approximately half the binding.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Following oral administration of 200 mg of 14C-bupropion in humans, 87% and 10% of the radioactive dose were recovered in the urine and feces, respectively.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The fraction of the oral dose of bupropion excreted unchanged was 0.5%, a finding consistent with the extensive metabolism of bupropion.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Following single oral administration of CONTRAVE tablets to healthy subjects, mean elimination half-life (T<U+00BD>) was approximately 21 hours for bupropion.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Elderly The pharmacokinetics of CONTRAVE have not been evaluated in the geriatric population.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of naltrexone or bupropion and their metabolites have not been fully characterized.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An exploration of steady-state bupropion concentrations from several depression efficacy studies involving patients dosed in a range of 300 to 750 mg/day, on a three times daily schedule, revealed no relationship between age (18 to 83 years) and plasma concentration of bupropion.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A single-dose pharmacokinetic study demonstrated that the disposition of bupropion and its metabolites in elderly subjects was similar to that of younger subjects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These data suggest there is no prominent effect of age on bupropion concentration; however, another pharmacokinetic study, single and multiple dose, has suggested that the elderly are at increased risk for accumulation of bupropion and its metabolites.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Smokers Pooled analysis of CONTRAVE data revealed no meaningful differences in the plasma concentrations of bupropion or naltrexone in smokers compared with nonsmokers.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effects of cigarette smoking on the pharmacokinetics of bupropion were studied in 34 healthy male and female volunteers; 17 were chronic cigarette smokers and 17 were nonsmokers.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These data also suggest that alterations in naltrexone bioavailability are related to liver disease severity.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Bupropion The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of bupropion was characterized in two single-dose trials, one trial in patients with alcoholic liver disease and a second trial in patients with mild-to-severe cirrhosis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The first trial showed that the half-life of hydroxybupropion was significantly longer in eight patients with alcoholic liver disease than in eight healthy volunteers (32<U+00B1>14 hours vs 21<U+00B1>5 hours, respectively).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Although not statistically significant, the AUCs for bupropion and hydroxybupropion were more variable and tended to be greater (by 53% to 57%) in patients with alcoholic liver disease.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The differences in half-life for bupropion and the other metabolites in the two patient groups were minimal.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The second trial demonstrated no statistically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of bupropion and its active metabolites in nine subjects with mild-to-moderate hepatic cirrhosis compared with eight healthy volunteers.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, more variability was observed in some of the pharmacokinetic parameters for bupropion (AUC, Cmax, and Tmax) and its active metabolites (t<U+00BD>) in subjects with mild-to-moderate hepatic cirrhosis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In subjects with severe hepatic cirrhosis, significant alterations in the pharmacokinetics of bupropion and its metabolites were seen (Table 4).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Pharmacokinetics of Bupropion and Metabolites in Patients With Severe Hepatic Cirrhosis: Ratio Relative to Healthy Matched Controls Cmax AUC t<U+00BD> Tmax = Difference Bupropion 1.69 3.12 1.43 0.5 h Hydroxybupropion 0.31 1.28 3.88 19 h Threo/erythrohydrobupropion amino alcohol 0.69 2.48 1.96 20 h The dose of CONTRAVE should be reduced in patients with hepatic impairment.

5	Bupropion Limited information is available for bupropion in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An inter-trial comparison between normal subjects and patients with end-stage renal failure demonstrated that the bupropion Cmax and AUC values were comparable in the two groups, whereas the hydroxybupropion and threohydrobupropion metabolites had a 2.3- and 2.8-fold increase, respectively, in AUC for patients with end-stage renal failure.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A second trial, comparing normal subjects and patients with moderate-to-severe renal impairment (GFR 30.9 <U+00B1> 10.8 mL/min) showed that exposure after a single 150 mg dose of sustained-release bupropion was approximately 2-fold higher in patients with impaired renal function while levels of the hydroxybupropion and threo/erythrohydrobupropion (combined) metabolites were similar in the two groups.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The elimination of bupropion and/or the major metabolites of bupropion may be reduced by impaired renal function.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor, which is believed to exert its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concentrations of the active intact hormones are increased by sitagliptin, thereby increasing and prolonging the action of these hormones.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme, DPP-4.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Sitagliptin demonstrates selectivity for DPP-4 and does not inhibit DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in vitro at concentrations approximating those from therapeutic doses.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	General In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, administration of sitagliptin led to inhibition of DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	After an oral glucose load or a meal, this DPP-4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of active GLP-1 and GIP, decreased glucagon concentrations, and increased responsiveness of insulin release to glucose, resulting in higher C-peptide and insulin concentrations.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The rise in insulin with the decrease in glucagon was associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a meal.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In studies with healthy subjects, sitagliptin did not lower blood glucose or cause hypoglycemia.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Sitagliptin and Metformin hydrochloride Coadministration In a two-day study in healthy subjects, sitagliptin alone increased active GLP-1 concentrations, whereas metformin alone increased active and total GLP-1 concentrations to similar extents.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Pediatric Patients Studies characterizing the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin in pediatric patients have not been performed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions Sitagliptin is not an inhibitor of CYP isozymes CYP3A4, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, 1A2, 2C19 or 2B6, and is not an inducer of CYP3A4.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Sitagliptin is a P-gp substrate, but does not inhibit P-gp mediated transport of digoxin.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Based on these results, sitagliptin is considered unlikely to cause interactions with other drugs that utilize these pathways.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, when VALTREX is coadministered with these drugs in patients with normal renal function, no dosage adjustment is recommended.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Antacids: The pharmacokinetics of acyclovir after a single dose of VALTREX (1 gram) were unchanged by coadministration of a single dose of antacids (Al3+ or Mg++).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Digoxin: The pharmacokinetics of digoxin were not affected by coadministration of VALTREX 1 gram 3 times daily, and the pharmacokinetics of acyclovir after a single dose of VALTREX (1 gram) was unchanged by coadministration of digoxin (2 doses of 0.75 mg).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thiazide Diuretics: The pharmacokinetics of acyclovir after a single dose of VALTREX (1 gram) were unchanged by coadministration of multiple doses of thiazide diuretics.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Mechanism of Action: Valacyclovir is a nucleoside analogue DNA polymerase inhibitor.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Valacyclovir hydrochloride is rapidly converted to acyclovir which has demonstrated antiviral activity against HSV types 1 (HSV<U+2500>1) and 2 (HSV<U+2500>2) and VZV both in cell culture and in vivo.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The inhibitory activity of acyclovir is highly selective due to its affinity for the enzyme thymidine kinase (TK) encoded by HSV and VZV.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This viral enzyme converts acyclovir into acyclovir monophosphate, a nucleotide analogue.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The monophosphate is further converted into diphosphate by cellular guanylate kinase and into triphosphate by a number of cellular enzymes.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In biochemical assays, acyclovir triphosphate inhibits replication of herpes viral DNA.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This is accomplished in 3 ways: 1) competitive inhibition of viral DNA polymerase, 2) incorporation and termination of the growing viral DNA chain, and 3) inactivation of the viral DNA polymerase.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The greater antiviral activity of acyclovir against HSV compared with VZV is due to its more efficient phosphorylation by the viral TK.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Antiviral Activities: The quantitative relationship between the cell culture susceptibility of herpesviruses to antivirals and the clinical response to therapy has not been established in humans, and virus sensitivity testing has not been standardized.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Sensitivity testing results, expressed as the concentration of drug required to inhibit by 50% the growth of virus in cell culture (EC50), vary greatly depending upon a number of factors.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Using plaque-reduction assays, the EC50 values against herpes simplex virus isolates range from 0.09 to 60 <U+03BC>M (0.02 to 13.5 mcg/mL) for HSV<U+2500>1 and from 0.04 to 44 <U+00B5>M (0.01 to 9.9 mcg/mL) for HSV<U+2500>2.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The EC50 values for acyclovir against most laboratory strains and clinical isolates of VZV range from 0.53 to 48 <U+00B5>M (0.12 to 10.8 mcg/mL).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Acyclovir also demonstrates activity against the Oka vaccine strain of VZV with a mean EC50 of 6 <U+00B5>M (1.35 mcg/mL).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Resistance: Resistance of HSV and VZV to acyclovir can result from qualitative and quantitative changes in the viral TK and/or DNA polymerase.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Clinical isolates of VZV with reduced susceptibility to acyclovir have been recovered from patients with AIDS.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In these cases, TK-deficient mutants of VZV have been recovered.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Resistance of HSV and VZV to acyclovir occurs by the same mechanisms.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	While most of the acyclovir<U+2500>resistant mutants isolated thus far from immunocompromised patients have been found to be TK<U+2500>deficient mutants, other mutants involving the viral TK gene (TK partial and TK altered) and DNA polymerase have also been isolated.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	TK<U+2500>negative mutants may cause severe disease in immunocompromised patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The possibility of viral resistance to valacyclovir (and therefore, to acyclovir) should be considered in patients who show poor clinical response during therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Pentazocine hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets should not be administered to patients who are hypersensitive to either pentazocine or acetaminophen.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The usual adult dose is 1 tablet every 4 hours as needed for pain relief, up to maximum of 6 tablets per day.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The usual duration of therapy is dependent upon the condition being treated but in any case should be reviewed regularly by the physician.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effect of meals on the rate and extent of bioavailability of both pentazocine and acetaminophen has not been documented.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Decreased metabolism of the drug by the liver in extensive liver disease may predispose to accentuation of side effects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Although laboratory tests have not indicated that pentazocine causes or increases renal or hepatic impairment, the drug should be administered with caution to patients with such impairment.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Since acetaminophen is metabolized by the liver, the question of the safety of its use in the presence of liver disease should be considered.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Narcotic drug products are generally considered to elevate biliary tract pressure for varying periods following their administration.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Some evidence suggests that pentazocine may differ from other marketed narcotics in this respect (i.e., it causes little or no elevation in biliary tract pressures).	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The clinical significance of these findings, however, is not yet known.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Caution should be used when pentazocine hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets are administered to patients prone to seizures; seizures have occurred in a few such patients in association with the use of pentazocine although no cause and effect relationship has been established.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Since sedation, dizziness, and occasional euphoria have been noted, ambulatory patients should be warned not to operate machinery, drive cars, or unnecessarily expose themselves to hazards.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Pentazocine may cause physical and psychological dependence when taken alone and may have additive CNS depressant properties when taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS depressants.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and impairment of fertility studies have not been done with this combination product.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Pentazocine, when administered orally or parenterally, had no adverse effect on either the reproductive capabilities or the course of pregnancy in rabbits and rats.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Embryotoxic effects on the fetuses were not shown.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The daily administration of 4 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg pentazocine subcutaneously to female rats during a 14 day pre-mating period and until the 13th day of pregnancy did not have any adverse effects on the fertility rate.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There is no evidence in long-term animal studies to demonstrate that pentazocine is carcinogenic.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with pentazocine hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is also not known whether pentazocine hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women or can affect reproduction capacity.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Pentazocine hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets should be given to pregnant women only if clearly needed.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, animal reproduction studies with pentazocine have not demonstrated teratogenic or embryotoxic effects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	However, there have been rare reports of possible abstinence syndromes in newborns after prolonged use of pentazocine during pregnancy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients receiving pentazocine during labor have experienced no adverse effects other than those that occur with commonly used analgesics.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Pentazocine hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets should be used with caution in women delivering premature infants.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effect of pentazocine hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets on the mother and fetus, the duration of labor or delivery, the possibility that forceps delivery or other intervention or resuscitation of the newborn may be necessary, or the effect of pentazocine hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets on the later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child are unknown at the present time.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when pentazocine hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets are administered to a nursing woman.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been established.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Clinical studies of pentazocine hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Head Injury and Increased Intracranial Pressure.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	As in the case of other potent analgesics, the potential of pentazocine for elevating cerebrospinal fluid pressure may be attributed to CO2 retention due to the respiratory depressant effects of the drug.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	These effects may be markedly exaggerated in the presence of head injury, other intracranial lesions, or a pre-existing increase in intracranial pressure.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Furthermore, pentazocine can produce effects which may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injuries.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In such patients, pentazocine hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets must be used with extreme caution and only if its use is deemed essential.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients receiving therapeutic doses of pentazocine have experienced hallucinations (usually visual), disorientation, and confusion which have cleared spontaneously within a period of hours.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The mechanism of this reaction is not known.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Such patients should be closely observed and vital signs checked.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If the drug is reinstituted, it should be done with caution since these acute CNS manifestations may recur.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There have been instances of psychological and physical dependence on parenteral pentazocine in patients with a history of drug abuse, and rarely, in patients without such a history.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Due to the potential for increased CNS depressant effects, alcohol should be used with caution in patients who are currently receiving pentazocine.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Pentazocine may precipitate opioid abstinence symptoms in patients receiving courses of opiates for pain relief.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Pentazocine hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets are an analgesic possessing antipyretic actions.	Non-Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed in patients treated with DEXILANT.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Simultaneous administration of drugs that inhibit the activity of liver microsomal enzymes, i.e., CYP3A4 inhibitors such as cimetidine and ketoconazole, may prolong the half-life and decrease the plasma clearance of tinidazole, increasing the plasma concentrations of tinidazole.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cholestyramine: Cholestyramine was shown to decrease the oral bioavailability of metronidazole by 21%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Administration of Tindamax tablets with food resulted in a delay in T max of approximately 2 hours and a decline in Cmax of approximately 10%, compared to fasted conditions.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In clinical studies, the majority of patients required a decrease in daily levodopa dose if their daily dose of levodopa had been greater than or equal to 800 mg or if patients had moderate or severe dyskinesia before beginning treatment.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	To optimize an individual patient's response, reductions in daily levodopa dose or extending the interval between doses may be necessary.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In clinical studies, the average reduction in daily levodopa dose was about 25% in those patients requiring a levodopa dose reduction (more than 58% of patients with levodopa doses above 800 mg daily required such a reduction).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When entacapone is given in conjunction with levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, such as carbidopa, plasma levels of levodopa are greater and more sustained than after administration of levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is believed that at a given frequency of levodopa administration, these more sustained plasma levels of levodopa result in more constant dopaminergic stimulation in the brain, leading to greater effects on the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When 200 mg entacapone is administered together with levodopa and carbidopa, it increases the area under the curve (AUC) of levodopa by approximately 35%, and the elimination half-life of levodopa is prolonged from 1.3 hours to 2.4 hours.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When colesevelam is coadministered with glipizide ER, maximum plasma concentration and total exposure to glipizide is reduced.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Lorazepam dosage needs to be reduced by approximately 50% when co-administered with probenecid.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effects of probenecid and valproate on lorazepam may be due to inhibition of glucuronidation.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In addition to appropriate levoleucovorin for injection therapy, continue hydration and urinary alkalinization, and monitoring of fluid and electrolyte status, until the serum methotrexate level has fallen to below 0.05 micromolar and the renal failure has resolved.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effect of leu co vorin products on fluorouracil : Leucovorin products increase the toxicity of fluorouracil.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Leucovorin products increase the toxicities of fluorouracil.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Coadministration of ACTOS and gemfibrozil, a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, increases pioglitazone exposure approximately 3-fold.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of ACTOS is 15 mg daily when used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Strong CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g., gemfibrozil) increase pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CYP2C8 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may decrease pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Topiramate may decrease pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An inhibitor of CYP2C8 (e.g., gemfibrozil) significantly increases the exposure (area under the serum concentration-time curve or AUC) and half-life (t1/2) of pioglitazone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of ACTOS is 15 mg daily if used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An inducer of CYP2C8 (e.g., rifampin) may significantly decrease the exposure (AUC) of pioglitazone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A decrease in the exposure of pioglitazone and its active metabolites were noted with concomitant administration of pioglitazone and topiramate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food delays the Tmax to three to four hours but does not alter the extent of absorption (AUC).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In an in vitro study in human liver microsomes, inhibition of CYP2A6 hydroxylation of coumarin by fondaparinux (200 micromolar i.e., 350 mg/L) was 17 to 28%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effects of NUVIGIL on CYP3A4/5 Substrates The clearance of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A4/5 (e.g., steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, and triazolam) may be increased by NUVIGIL via induction of metabolic enzymes, which results in lower systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Blood levels of cyclosporine may be reduced when used with NUVIGIL.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effects of NUVIGIL on CYP2C19 Substrates Elimination of drugs that are substrates for CYP2C19 (e.g., phenytoin, diazepam, propranolol, omeprazole, and clomipramine) may be prolonged by NUVIGIL via inhibition of metabolic enzymes, with resultant higher systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cyclosporine: blood concentrations of cyclosporine may be reduced.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CYP2C19 substrates, such as omeprazole, phenytoin, and diazepam: exposure of these medications may be increased.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food effect on the overall bioavailability of NUVIGIL is considered minimal; however, time to reach peak concentration (tmax) may be delayed by approximately 2-4 hours in the fed state.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 250 mg resulted in a reduction in systemic exposure to midazolam by 32% after a single oral dose (5 mg) and 17% after a single intravenous dose (2 mg).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the blood levels and effectiveness of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A enzymes (e.g., steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, and triazolam) may be reduced after initiation of concomitant treatment with NUVIGIL.In a separate clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 250 mg with quetiapine (300 mg to 600 mg daily doses) resulted in a reduction in the mean systemic exposure of quetiapine by approximately 29%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 400 mg resulted in a 40% increase in exposure to omeprazole after a single oral dose (40 mg), as a result of moderate inhibition of CYP2C19 activity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Interactions with CNS Active Drugs Concomitant administration of NUVIGIL with quetiapine reduced the systemic exposure of quetiapine.Data specific to NUVIGIL drug-drug interaction potential with other CNS active drugs are not available.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant administration of modafinil with methylphenidate or dextroamphetamine produced no significant alterations on the pharmacokinetic profile of modafinil or either stimulant, even though the absorption of modafinil was delayed for approximately one hour.Concomitant modafinil or clomipramine did not alter the pharmacokinetic profile of either drug; however, one incident of increased levels of clomipramine and its active metabolite desmethylclomipramine was reported in a patient with narcolepsy during treatment with modafinil.Data specific to NUVIGIL or modafinil drug-drug interaction potential with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors are not available.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Barbiturates can induce hepatic microsomal enzymes, resulting in increased metabolism and decreased anticoagulant response of oral anticoagulants (eg, warfarin, acenocoumarol, dicumarol, and phenprocoumon).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Corticosteroids Barbiturates appear to enhance the metabolism of exogenous corticosteroids, probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Griseofulvin Phenobarbital appears to interfere with the absorption of orally administered griseofulvin, thus decreasing its blood level.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effect of the resultant decreased blood levels of griseofulvin on therapeutic response has not been established.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Doxycycline Phenobarbital has been shown to shorten the half-life of doxycycline for as long as 2 weeks after barbiturate therapy is discontinued.This mechanism is probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes that metabolize the antibiotic.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Sodium valproate and valproic acid increase the secobarbital sodium serum levels; therefore, secobarbital sodium blood levels should be monitored closely and appropriate dosage adjustments made as clinically indicated.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Estradiol, Estrone, Progesterone, and Other Steroidal Hormones Pretreatment with or concurrent administration of phenobarbital may decrease the effect of estradiol by increasing its metabolism.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hepatic enzyme-inducing drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone, rifampin) can increase valproate clearance, while enzyme inhibitors (e.g., felbamate) can decrease valproate clearance.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For example, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital (or primidone) can double the clearance of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thus, patients on monotherapy will generally have longer half-lives and higher concentrations than patients receiving polytherapy with antiepilepsy drugs.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Increasing the felbamate dose to 2,400 mg/day increased the mean valproate peak concentration to 133 mcg/mL (another 16% increase).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A decrease in valproate dosage may be necessary when felbamate therapy is initiated.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rifampin A study involving the administration of a single dose of valproate (7 mg/kg) 36 hours after 5 nights of daily dosing with rifampin (600 mg) revealed a 40% increase in the oral clearance of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rare postmarketing reports of concurrent use of valproate and amitriptyline resulting in an increased amitriptyline level have been received.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Consideration should be given to lowering the dose of amitriptyline/nortriptyline in the presence of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Administration of a single ethosuximide dose of 500 mg with valproate (800 to 1,600 mg/day) to healthy volunteers (n = 6) was accompanied by a 25% increase in elimination half-life of ethosuximide and a 15% decrease in its total clearance as compared to ethosuximide alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lamotrigine In a steady-state study involving 10 healthy volunteers, the elimination half-life of lamotrigine increased from 26 to 70 hours with valproate co-administration (a 165% increase).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The dose of lamotrigine should be reduced when co-administered with valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Phenobarbital Valproate was found to inhibit the metabolism of phenobarbital.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Co-administration of valproate (250 mg BID for 14 days) with phenobarbital to normal subjects (n = 6) resulted in a 50% increase in half-life and a 30% decrease in plasma clearance of phenobarbital (60 mg single-dose).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The fraction of phenobarbital dose excreted unchanged increased by 50% in presence of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Serum barbiturate concentrations should be obtained, if possible, and the barbiturate dosage decreased, if appropriate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Rufinamide Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, rufinamide clearance was decreased by valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rufinamide concentrations were increased by <16% to 70%, dependent on concentration of valproate (with the larger increases being seen in pediatric patients at high doses or concentrations of valproate).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients stabilized on rufinamide before being prescribed valproate should begin valproate therapy at a low dose, and titrate to a clinically effective dose.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Similarly, patients on valproate should begin at a rufinamide dose lower than 10 mg/kg per day (pediatric patients) or 400 mg per day (adults).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Tolbutamide From in vitro experiments, the unbound fraction of tolbutamide was increased from 20% to 50% when added to plasma samples taken from patients treated with valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Lorazepam Concomitant administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and lorazepam (1 mg BID) in normal male volunteers (n = 9) was accompanied by a 17% decrease in the plasma clearance of lorazepam.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Co-administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and olanzapine (5 mg) to healthy adults (n=10) caused 15% reduction in Cmax and 35% reduction in AUC of olanzapine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Protein binding of valproate is reduced in the elderly, in patients with chronic hepatic diseases, in patients with renal impairment, and in the presence of other drugs (e.g., aspirin).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Conversely, valproate may displace certain protein-bound drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, warfarin, and tolbutamide).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For example, patients taking enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital) will clear valproate more rapidly.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Steady-state trough concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide were about 56% higher when 8 mg dexamethasone was co-administered with each dose of albendazole (15 mg/kg/day) in 8 neurocysticercosis patients.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In the fed state, praziquantel (40 mg/kg) increased mean maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve of albendazole sulfoxide by about 50% in healthy subjects (n = 10) compared with a separate group of subjects (n = 6) given albendazole alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Albendazole sulfoxide concentrations in bile and cystic fluid were increased (about 2-fold) in hydatid cyst patients treated with cimetidine (10 mg/kg/day) (n = 7) compared with albendazole (20 mg/kg/day) alone (n = 12).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Oral bioavailability appears to be enhanced when albendazole is coadministered with a fatty meal (estimated fat content 40 grams) as evidenced by higher (up to 5-fold on average) plasma concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide as compared to the fasted state.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, CONTRAVE should not be taken with a high-fat meal because of a resulting significant increase in bupropion and naltrexone systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During concomitant use with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel), the maximum recommended daily dose of CONTRAVE is two tablets (one tablet each morning and evening).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6: Bupropion inhibits CYP2D6 and can increase concentrations of: antidepressants, (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and many tricyclics), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide): Consider dose reduction when using with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant Treatment with CYP2B6 Inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel) can increase bupropion exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Do not exceed one tablet twice daily when taken with CYP2B6 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Studies in animals demonstrate that the acute toxicity of bupropion is enhanced by the MAOI phenelzine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CONTRAVE increased metoprolol AUC and Cmax by approximately 4- and 2-fold, respectively, relative to metoprolol alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Similar clinical drug interactions resulting in increased pharmacokinetic exposure of CYP2D6 substrates have also been observed with bupropion as a single agent with desipramine or venlafaxine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Coadministration of CONTRAVE with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isozyme including certain antidepressants (SSRIs and many tricyclics), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If CONTRAVE is added to the treatment regimen of a patient already receiving a drug metabolized by CYP2D6, the need to decrease the dose of the original medication should be considered, particularly for those concomitant medications with a narrow therapeutic index.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Inhibitors of CYP2B6: Ticlopidine and Clopidogrel: Concomitant treatment with these drugs can increase bupropion exposure but decrease hydroxybupropion exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During concomitant use with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel), the CONTRAVE daily dose should not exceed two tablets (one tablet each morning and evening).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The systemic concentrations of substrate drugs transported by OCT2 (such as amantadine, amiloride, cimetidine, dopamine, famotidine, memantine, metformin, pindolol, procainamide, ranitidine, varenicline, oxaliplatin) are likely to increase as a result of reduced renal clearance when coadministered with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food Effect on Absorption When CONTRAVE was administered with a high-fat meal, the AUC and Cmax for naltrexone increased 2.1-fold and 3.7-fold, respectively, and the AUC and Cmax for bupropion increased 1.4-fold and 1.8-fold, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	At steady state, the food effect increased AUC and Cmax for naltrexone by 1.7-fold and 1.9-fold, respectively, and increased AUC and Cmax for bupropion by 1.1-fold and 1.3-fold, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thus, CONTRAVE should not be taken with high-fat meals because of the resulting significant increases in bupropion and naltrexone systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In vitro studies suggest that paroxetine, sertraline, norfluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and nelfinavir inhibit the hydroxylation of bupropion.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The systemic concentrations of substrate drugs transported by OCT2 are likely to increase as a result of reduced renal clearance when coadministered with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	While not systematically studied, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or phenytoin may induce the metabolism of bupropion.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Chlorpheniramine may inhibit the hepatic metabolism of phenytoin, monitor phenytoin toxicity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The concurrent use of drugs that preferentially induce codeine N-demethylation (via CYP3A4) may increase the plasma concentrations of codeine<U+2019>s inactive metabolite norcodeine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Cimetidine Plus Probenecid: Acyclovir Cmax and AUC following a single dose of VALTREX (1 gram) increased by 30% and 78%, respectively, after a combination of cimetidine and probenecid, primarily due to a reduction in renal clearance of acyclovir.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Probenecid: Acyclovir Cmax and AUC following a single dose of VALTREX (1 gram) increased by 22% and 49%, respectively, after probenecid (1 gram).	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12) Deficiency: Daily long-term use (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption or a deficiency of cyanocobalamin.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Interaction with Methotrexate: Concomitant use with PPIs may elevate and/or prolong serum concentrations of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to toxicity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than three years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed in patients treated with DEXILANT.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effect on Food In food-effect studies in healthy subjects receiving DEXILANT under various fed conditions compared to fasting, increases in Cmax ranged from 12 to 55%, increases in AUC ranged from 9 to 37%, and Tmax varied (ranging from a decrease of 0.7 hours to an increase of three hours).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The mean AUC of the active metabolite of clopidogrel was reduced by approximately 9% (mean AUC ratio was 91%, with 90% CI of 86 to 97%) when DEXILANT was co-administered compared to administration of clopidogrel alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lithium generally should not be given with diuretics because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A number of drugs, including ethacrynic acid, have been shown to displace warfarin from plasma protein; a reduction in the usual anticoagulant dosage may be required in patients receiving both drugs.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lithium: Metronidazole has been reported to elevate serum lithium levels.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Phenytoin, Fosphenytoin: Concomitant administration of oral metronidazole and intravenous phenytoin was reported to result in prolongation of the half-life and reduction in the clearance of phenytoin.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cyclosporine, Tacrolimus: There are several case reports suggesting that metronidazole has the potential to increase the levels of cyclosporine and tacrolimus.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CYP3A4 Inducers and Inhibitors: Simultaneous administration of tinidazole with drugs that induce liver microsomal enzymes, i.e., CYP3A4 inducers such as phenobarbital, rifampin, phenytoin, and fosphenytoin (a pro-drug of phenytoin), may accelerate the elimination of tinidazole, decreasing the plasma level of tinidazole.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Simultaneous administration of drugs that inhibit the activity of liver microsomal enzymes, i.e., CYP3A4 inhibitors such as cimetidine and ketoconazole, may prolong the half-life and decrease the plasma clearance of tinidazole, increasing the plasma concentrations of tinidazole.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cholestyramine: Cholestyramine was shown to decrease the oral bioavailability of metronidazole by 21%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Administration of Tindamax tablets with food resulted in a delay in T max of approximately 2 hours and a decline in Cmax of approximately 10%, compared to fasted conditions.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In clinical studies, the majority of patients required a decrease in daily levodopa dose if their daily dose of levodopa had been greater than or equal to 800 mg or if patients had moderate or severe dyskinesia before beginning treatment.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	To optimize an individual patient's response, reductions in daily levodopa dose or extending the interval between doses may be necessary.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In clinical studies, the average reduction in daily levodopa dose was about 25% in those patients requiring a levodopa dose reduction (more than 58% of patients with levodopa doses above 800 mg daily required such a reduction).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When entacapone is given in conjunction with levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, such as carbidopa, plasma levels of levodopa are greater and more sustained than after administration of levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is believed that at a given frequency of levodopa administration, these more sustained plasma levels of levodopa result in more constant dopaminergic stimulation in the brain, leading to greater effects on the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When 200 mg entacapone is administered together with levodopa and carbidopa, it increases the area under the curve (AUC) of levodopa by approximately 35%, and the elimination half-life of levodopa is prolonged from 1.3 hours to 2.4 hours.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When colesevelam is coadministered with glipizide ER, maximum plasma concentration and total exposure to glipizide is reduced.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The mean percentage increase in the GLUCOTROL AUC after fluconazole administration was 56.9% (range: 35 to 81).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In studies assessing the effect of colesevelam on the pharmacokinetics of glipizide ER in healthy volunteers, reductions in glipizide AUC0<U+2013><U+221E> and Cmax of 12% and 13%, respectively were observed when colesevelam was coadministered with glipizide ER.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, GLUCOTROL should be administered at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam to ensure that colesevelam does not reduce the absorption of glipizide.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Total absorption and disposition of an oral dose was unaffected by food in normal volunteers, but absorption was delayed by about 40 minutes.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concurrent administration of lorazepam with valproate results in increased plasma concentrations and reduced clearance of lorazepam.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lorazepam dosage should be reduced to approximately 50% when co-administered with valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concurrent administration of lorazepam with probenecid may result in a more rapid onset or prolonged effect of lorazepam due to increased half-life and decreased total clearance.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lorazepam dosage needs to be reduced by approximately 50% when co-administered with probenecid.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effects of probenecid and valproate on lorazepam may be due to inhibition of glucuronidation.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Continue until methotrexate level is below 5 x 10-8 M (0.05 micromolar).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Continue Levoleucovorin for injection administration, hydration, and urinary alkalinization (pH 7.0 or greater) until the methotrexate level is below 5 x 10-8 M (0.05 micromolar).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Delayed late methotrexate elimination Serum methotrexate level remaining above 0.2 micromolar at 72 hours, and more than 0.05 micromolar at 96 hours after administration.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Continue 7.5 mg by intravenous infusion every 6 hours, until methotrexate level is less than 0.05 micromolar.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Delayed early methotrexate elimination and/or evidence of acute renal injury* Serum methotrexate level of 50 micromolar or more at 24 hours, or 5 micromolar or more at 48 hours after administration, OR 100% or greater increase in serum creatinine level at 24 hours after methotrexate administration (e.g., an increase from 0.5 mg/dL to a level of 1 mg/dL or more).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In addition to appropriate levoleucovorin for injection therapy, continue hydration and urinary alkalinization, and monitoring of fluid and electrolyte status, until the serum methotrexate level has fallen to below 0.05 micromolar and the renal failure has resolved.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effect of leu co vorin products on fluorouracil : Leucovorin products increase the toxicity of fluorouracil.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Leucovorin products increase the toxicities of fluorouracil.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Coadministration of ACTOS and gemfibrozil, a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, increases pioglitazone exposure approximately 3-fold.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of ACTOS is 15 mg daily when used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Strong CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g., gemfibrozil) increase pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CYP2C8 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may decrease pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Topiramate may decrease pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An inhibitor of CYP2C8 (e.g., gemfibrozil) significantly increases the exposure (area under the serum concentration-time curve or AUC) and half-life (t1/2) of pioglitazone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of ACTOS is 15 mg daily if used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An inducer of CYP2C8 (e.g., rifampin) may significantly decrease the exposure (AUC) of pioglitazone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A decrease in the exposure of pioglitazone and its active metabolites were noted with concomitant administration of pioglitazone and topiramate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food delays the Tmax to three to four hours but does not alter the extent of absorption (AUC).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In an in vitro study in human liver microsomes, inhibition of CYP2A6 hydroxylation of coumarin by fondaparinux (200 micromolar i.e., 350 mg/L) was 17 to 28%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effects of NUVIGIL on CYP3A4/5 Substrates The clearance of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A4/5 (e.g., steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, and triazolam) may be increased by NUVIGIL via induction of metabolic enzymes, which results in lower systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Blood levels of cyclosporine may be reduced when used with NUVIGIL.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effects of NUVIGIL on CYP2C19 Substrates Elimination of drugs that are substrates for CYP2C19 (e.g., phenytoin, diazepam, propranolol, omeprazole, and clomipramine) may be prolonged by NUVIGIL via inhibition of metabolic enzymes, with resultant higher systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cyclosporine: blood concentrations of cyclosporine may be reduced.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CYP2C19 substrates, such as omeprazole, phenytoin, and diazepam: exposure of these medications may be increased.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food effect on the overall bioavailability of NUVIGIL is considered minimal; however, time to reach peak concentration (tmax) may be delayed by approximately 2-4 hours in the fed state.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 250 mg resulted in a reduction in systemic exposure to midazolam by 32% after a single oral dose (5 mg) and 17% after a single intravenous dose (2 mg).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the blood levels and effectiveness of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A enzymes (e.g., steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, and triazolam) may be reduced after initiation of concomitant treatment with NUVIGIL.In a separate clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 250 mg with quetiapine (300 mg to 600 mg daily doses) resulted in a reduction in the mean systemic exposure of quetiapine by approximately 29%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 400 mg resulted in a 40% increase in exposure to omeprazole after a single oral dose (40 mg), as a result of moderate inhibition of CYP2C19 activity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Interactions with CNS Active Drugs Concomitant administration of NUVIGIL with quetiapine reduced the systemic exposure of quetiapine.Data specific to NUVIGIL drug-drug interaction potential with other CNS active drugs are not available.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant administration of modafinil with methylphenidate or dextroamphetamine produced no significant alterations on the pharmacokinetic profile of modafinil or either stimulant, even though the absorption of modafinil was delayed for approximately one hour.Concomitant modafinil or clomipramine did not alter the pharmacokinetic profile of either drug; however, one incident of increased levels of clomipramine and its active metabolite desmethylclomipramine was reported in a patient with narcolepsy during treatment with modafinil.Data specific to NUVIGIL or modafinil drug-drug interaction potential with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors are not available.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Barbiturates can induce hepatic microsomal enzymes, resulting in increased metabolism and decreased anticoagulant response of oral anticoagulants (eg, warfarin, acenocoumarol, dicumarol, and phenprocoumon).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Corticosteroids Barbiturates appear to enhance the metabolism of exogenous corticosteroids, probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Griseofulvin Phenobarbital appears to interfere with the absorption of orally administered griseofulvin, thus decreasing its blood level.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effect of the resultant decreased blood levels of griseofulvin on therapeutic response has not been established.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Doxycycline Phenobarbital has been shown to shorten the half-life of doxycycline for as long as 2 weeks after barbiturate therapy is discontinued.This mechanism is probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes that metabolize the antibiotic.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Sodium valproate and valproic acid increase the secobarbital sodium serum levels; therefore, secobarbital sodium blood levels should be monitored closely and appropriate dosage adjustments made as clinically indicated.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Estradiol, Estrone, Progesterone, and Other Steroidal Hormones Pretreatment with or concurrent administration of phenobarbital may decrease the effect of estradiol by increasing its metabolism.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hepatic enzyme-inducing drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone, rifampin) can increase valproate clearance, while enzyme inhibitors (e.g., felbamate) can decrease valproate clearance.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For example, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital (or primidone) can double the clearance of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thus, patients on monotherapy will generally have longer half-lives and higher concentrations than patients receiving polytherapy with antiepilepsy drugs.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drugs for which a potentially important interaction has been observed Aspirin A study involving the co-administration of aspirin at antipyretic doses (11 to 16 mg/kg) with valproate to pediatric patients (n = 6) revealed a decrease in protein binding and an inhibition of metabolism of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Valproate free fraction was increased 4-fold in the presence of aspirin compared to valproate alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The <U+03B2>-oxidation pathway consisting of 2-E-valproic acid, 3-OH-valproic acid, and 3-keto valproic acid was decreased from 25% of total metabolites excreted on valproate alone to 8.3% in the presence of aspirin.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Increasing the felbamate dose to 2,400 mg/day increased the mean valproate peak concentration to 133 mcg/mL (another 16% increase).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A decrease in valproate dosage may be necessary when felbamate therapy is initiated.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rifampin A study involving the administration of a single dose of valproate (7 mg/kg) 36 hours after 5 nights of daily dosing with rifampin (600 mg) revealed a 40% increase in the oral clearance of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Chlorpromazine A study involving the administration of 100 to 300 mg/day of chlorpromazine to schizophrenic patients already receiving valproate (200 mg BID) revealed a 15% increase in trough plasma levels of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drugs for which a potentially important valproate interaction has been observed Amitriptyline/Nortriptyline Administration of a single oral 50 mg dose of amitriptyline to 15 normal volunteers (10 males and 5 females) who received valproate (500 mg BID) resulted in a 21% decrease in plasma clearance of amitriptyline and a 34% decrease in the net clearance of nortriptyline.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rare postmarketing reports of concurrent use of valproate and amitriptyline resulting in an increased amitriptyline level have been received.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Consideration should be given to lowering the dose of amitriptyline/nortriptyline in the presence of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Carbamazepine/carbamazepine-10,11-Epoxide Serum levels of carbamazepine (CBZ) decreased 17% while that of carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide (CBZ-E) increased by 45% upon co-administration of valproate and CBZ to epileptic patients.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Diazepam Valproate displaces diazepam from its plasma albumin binding sites and inhibits its metabolism.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Plasma clearance and volume of distribution for free diazepam were reduced by 25% and 20%, respectively, in the presence of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Ethosuximide Valproate inhibits the metabolism of ethosuximide.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Administration of a single ethosuximide dose of 500 mg with valproate (800 to 1,600 mg/day) to healthy volunteers (n = 6) was accompanied by a 25% increase in elimination half-life of ethosuximide and a 15% decrease in its total clearance as compared to ethosuximide alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lamotrigine In a steady-state study involving 10 healthy volunteers, the elimination half-life of lamotrigine increased from 26 to 70 hours with valproate co-administration (a 165% increase).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The dose of lamotrigine should be reduced when co-administered with valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Phenobarbital Valproate was found to inhibit the metabolism of phenobarbital.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Co-administration of valproate (250 mg BID for 14 days) with phenobarbital to normal subjects (n = 6) resulted in a 50% increase in half-life and a 30% decrease in plasma clearance of phenobarbital (60 mg single-dose).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The fraction of phenobarbital dose excreted unchanged increased by 50% in presence of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Serum barbiturate concentrations should be obtained, if possible, and the barbiturate dosage decreased, if appropriate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Phenytoin Valproate displaces phenytoin from its plasma albumin binding sites and inhibits its hepatic metabolism.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Co-administration of valproate (400 mg TID) with phenytoin (250 mg) in normal volunteers (n = 7) was associated with a 60% increase in the free fraction of phenytoin.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Total plasma clearance and apparent volume of distribution of phenytoin increased 30% in the presence of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Both the clearance and apparent volume of distribution of free phenytoin were reduced by 25%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Propofol The concomitant use of valproate and propofol may lead to increased blood levels of propofol.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Reduce the dose of propofol when co-administering with valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rufinamide Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, rufinamide clearance was decreased by valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rufinamide concentrations were increased by <16% to 70%, dependent on concentration of valproate (with the larger increases being seen in pediatric patients at high doses or concentrations of valproate).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients stabilized on rufinamide before being prescribed valproate should begin valproate therapy at a low dose, and titrate to a clinically effective dose.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Similarly, patients on valproate should begin at a rufinamide dose lower than 10 mg/kg per day (pediatric patients) or 400 mg per day (adults).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Tolbutamide From in vitro experiments, the unbound fraction of tolbutamide was increased from 20% to 50% when added to plasma samples taken from patients treated with valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Warfarin In an in vitro study, valproate increased the unbound fraction of warfarin by up to 32.6%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Zidovudine In six patients who were seropositive for HIV, the clearance of zidovudine (100 mg q8h) was decreased by 38% after administration of valproate (250 or 500 mg q8h); the half-life of zidovudine was unaffected.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lorazepam Concomitant administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and lorazepam (1 mg BID) in normal male volunteers (n = 9) was accompanied by a 17% decrease in the plasma clearance of lorazepam.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Co-administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and olanzapine (5 mg) to healthy adults (n=10) caused 15% reduction in Cmax and 35% reduction in AUC of olanzapine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Protein binding of valproate is reduced in the elderly, in patients with chronic hepatic diseases, in patients with renal impairment, and in the presence of other drugs (e.g., aspirin).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Conversely, valproate may displace certain protein-bound drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, warfarin, and tolbutamide).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For example, patients taking enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital) will clear valproate more rapidly.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dexamethasone: Steady-state trough concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide were about 56% higher when dexamethasone was coadministered with each dose of albendazole.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Praziquantel: In the fed state increased mean maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve of albendazole sulfoxide by about 50% in healthy subjects.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cimetidine: Increased albendazole sulfoxide concentrations in bile and cystic fluid by about 2-fold in hydatid cyst patients.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Steady-state trough concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide were about 56% higher when 8 mg dexamethasone was co-administered with each dose of albendazole (15 mg/kg/day) in 8 neurocysticercosis patients.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In the fed state, praziquantel (40 mg/kg) increased mean maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve of albendazole sulfoxide by about 50% in healthy subjects (n = 10) compared with a separate group of subjects (n = 6) given albendazole alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Albendazole sulfoxide concentrations in bile and cystic fluid were increased (about 2-fold) in hydatid cyst patients treated with cimetidine (10 mg/kg/day) (n = 7) compared with albendazole (20 mg/kg/day) alone (n = 12).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Oral bioavailability appears to be enhanced when albendazole is coadministered with a fatty meal (estimated fat content 40 grams) as evidenced by higher (up to 5-fold on average) plasma concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide as compared to the fasted state.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, CONTRAVE should not be taken with a high-fat meal because of a resulting significant increase in bupropion and naltrexone systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During concomitant use with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel), the maximum recommended daily dose of CONTRAVE is two tablets (one tablet each morning and evening).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6: Bupropion inhibits CYP2D6 and can increase concentrations of: antidepressants, (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and many tricyclics), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide): Consider dose reduction when using with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant Treatment with CYP2B6 Inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel) can increase bupropion exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Do not exceed one tablet twice daily when taken with CYP2B6 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Studies in animals demonstrate that the acute toxicity of bupropion is enhanced by the MAOI phenelzine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CONTRAVE increased metoprolol AUC and Cmax by approximately 4- and 2-fold, respectively, relative to metoprolol alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Similar clinical drug interactions resulting in increased pharmacokinetic exposure of CYP2D6 substrates have also been observed with bupropion as a single agent with desipramine or venlafaxine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Coadministration of CONTRAVE with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isozyme including certain antidepressants (SSRIs and many tricyclics), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If CONTRAVE is added to the treatment regimen of a patient already receiving a drug metabolized by CYP2D6, the need to decrease the dose of the original medication should be considered, particularly for those concomitant medications with a narrow therapeutic index.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Inhibitors of CYP2B6: Ticlopidine and Clopidogrel: Concomitant treatment with these drugs can increase bupropion exposure but decrease hydroxybupropion exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During concomitant use with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel), the CONTRAVE daily dose should not exceed two tablets (one tablet each morning and evening).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The systemic concentrations of substrate drugs transported by OCT2 (such as amantadine, amiloride, cimetidine, dopamine, famotidine, memantine, metformin, pindolol, procainamide, ranitidine, varenicline, oxaliplatin) are likely to increase as a result of reduced renal clearance when coadministered with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food Effect on Absorption When CONTRAVE was administered with a high-fat meal, the AUC and Cmax for naltrexone increased 2.1-fold and 3.7-fold, respectively, and the AUC and Cmax for bupropion increased 1.4-fold and 1.8-fold, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	At steady state, the food effect increased AUC and Cmax for naltrexone by 1.7-fold and 1.9-fold, respectively, and increased AUC and Cmax for bupropion by 1.1-fold and 1.3-fold, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thus, CONTRAVE should not be taken with high-fat meals because of the resulting significant increases in bupropion and naltrexone systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In vitro studies suggest that paroxetine, sertraline, norfluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and nelfinavir inhibit the hydroxylation of bupropion.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The systemic concentrations of substrate drugs transported by OCT2 are likely to increase as a result of reduced renal clearance when coadministered with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	While not systematically studied, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or phenytoin may induce the metabolism of bupropion.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Chlorpheniramine may inhibit the hepatic metabolism of phenytoin, monitor phenytoin toxicity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The concurrent use of drugs that preferentially induce codeine N-demethylation (via CYP3A4) may increase the plasma concentrations of codeine<U+2019>s inactive metabolite norcodeine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drugs that inhibit codeine O-demethylation (via CYP2D6), may decrease the plasma concentration of codeine<U+2019>s active metabolites, morphine and morphine-6-glucuronide.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Adverse event reports in the literature suggest a possible drug interaction involving increased serum phenytoin levels and phenytoin toxicity when chlorpheniramine and phenytoin are co-administered.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The exact mechanism for this interaction is not known, however it is believed that chlorpheniramine may inhibit the hepatic metabolism of phenytoin.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There was a slight increase in the area under the curve (AUC, 11%) and mean peak drug concentration (Cmax, 18%) of digoxin with the coadministration of 100 mg sitagliptin for 10 days.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cimetidine: Acyclovir Cmax and AUC following a single dose of VALTREX (1 gram) increased by 8% and 32%, respectively, after a single dose of cimetidine (800 mg).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cimetidine Plus Probenecid: Acyclovir Cmax and AUC following a single dose of VALTREX (1 gram) increased by 30% and 78%, respectively, after a combination of cimetidine and probenecid, primarily due to a reduction in renal clearance of acyclovir.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Probenecid: Acyclovir Cmax and AUC following a single dose of VALTREX (1 gram) increased by 22% and 49%, respectively, after probenecid (1 gram).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Administration with rifampin or rifabutin is known to reduce atovaquone concentrations; concomitant use with MALARONE is not recommended.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant administration of rifampin or rifabutin is known to reduce atovaquone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant treatment with tetracycline has been associated with a reduction in plasma concentrations of atovaquone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	While antiemetics may be indicated for patients receiving MALARONE, metoclopramide may reduce the bioavailability of atovaquone and should be used only if other antiemetics are not available.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant administration of atovaquone and indinavir did not result in any change in the steady<U+2011>state AUC and Cmax of indinavir but resulted in a decrease in the Ctrough of indinavir.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Caution should be exercised when prescribing atovaquone with indinavir due to the decrease in trough concentrations of indinavir.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dietary fat taken with atovaquone increases the rate and extent of absorption, increasing AUC 2 to 3 times and Cmax 5 times over fasting.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed in patients treated with DEXILANT.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Simultaneous administration of drugs that inhibit the activity of liver microsomal enzymes, i.e., CYP3A4 inhibitors such as cimetidine and ketoconazole, may prolong the half-life and decrease the plasma clearance of tinidazole, increasing the plasma concentrations of tinidazole.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Administration of Tindamax tablets with food resulted in a delay in T max of approximately 2 hours and a decline in Cmax of approximately 10%, compared to fasted conditions.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In clinical studies, the majority of patients required a decrease in daily levodopa dose if their daily dose of levodopa had been greater than or equal to 800 mg or if patients had moderate or severe dyskinesia before beginning treatment.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	To optimize an individual patient's response, reductions in daily levodopa dose or extending the interval between doses may be necessary.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In clinical studies, the average reduction in daily levodopa dose was about 25% in those patients requiring a levodopa dose reduction (more than 58% of patients with levodopa doses above 800 mg daily required such a reduction).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When entacapone is given in conjunction with levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, such as carbidopa, plasma levels of levodopa are greater and more sustained than after administration of levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is believed that at a given frequency of levodopa administration, these more sustained plasma levels of levodopa result in more constant dopaminergic stimulation in the brain, leading to greater effects on the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When 200 mg entacapone is administered together with levodopa and carbidopa, it increases the area under the curve (AUC) of levodopa by approximately 35%, and the elimination half-life of levodopa is prolonged from 1.3 hours to 2.4 hours.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Lorazepam dosage needs to be reduced by approximately 50% when co-administered with probenecid.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effects of probenecid and valproate on lorazepam may be due to inhibition of glucuronidation.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In addition to appropriate levoleucovorin for injection therapy, continue hydration and urinary alkalinization, and monitoring of fluid and electrolyte status, until the serum methotrexate level has fallen to below 0.05 micromolar and the renal failure has resolved.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effect of leu co vorin products on fluorouracil : Leucovorin products increase the toxicity of fluorouracil.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Coadministration of ACTOS and gemfibrozil, a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, increases pioglitazone exposure approximately 3-fold.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of ACTOS is 15 mg daily when used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Strong CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g., gemfibrozil) increase pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CYP2C8 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may decrease pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Topiramate may decrease pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An inhibitor of CYP2C8 (e.g., gemfibrozil) significantly increases the exposure (area under the serum concentration-time curve or AUC) and half-life (t1/2) of pioglitazone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of ACTOS is 15 mg daily if used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An inducer of CYP2C8 (e.g., rifampin) may significantly decrease the exposure (AUC) of pioglitazone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A decrease in the exposure of pioglitazone and its active metabolites were noted with concomitant administration of pioglitazone and topiramate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food delays the Tmax to three to four hours but does not alter the extent of absorption (AUC).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In an in vitro study in human liver microsomes, inhibition of CYP2A6 hydroxylation of coumarin by fondaparinux (200 micromolar i.e., 350 mg/L) was 17 to 28%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effects of NUVIGIL on CYP3A4/5 Substrates The clearance of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A4/5 (e.g., steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, and triazolam) may be increased by NUVIGIL via induction of metabolic enzymes, which results in lower systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Effects of NUVIGIL on CYP2C19 Substrates Elimination of drugs that are substrates for CYP2C19 (e.g., phenytoin, diazepam, propranolol, omeprazole, and clomipramine) may be prolonged by NUVIGIL via inhibition of metabolic enzymes, with resultant higher systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cyclosporine: blood concentrations of cyclosporine may be reduced.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CYP2C19 substrates, such as omeprazole, phenytoin, and diazepam: exposure of these medications may be increased.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food effect on the overall bioavailability of NUVIGIL is considered minimal; however, time to reach peak concentration (tmax) may be delayed by approximately 2-4 hours in the fed state.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 250 mg resulted in a reduction in systemic exposure to midazolam by 32% after a single oral dose (5 mg) and 17% after a single intravenous dose (2 mg).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the blood levels and effectiveness of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A enzymes (e.g., steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, and triazolam) may be reduced after initiation of concomitant treatment with NUVIGIL.In a separate clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 250 mg with quetiapine (300 mg to 600 mg daily doses) resulted in a reduction in the mean systemic exposure of quetiapine by approximately 29%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 400 mg resulted in a 40% increase in exposure to omeprazole after a single oral dose (40 mg), as a result of moderate inhibition of CYP2C19 activity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Concomitant administration of modafinil with methylphenidate or dextroamphetamine produced no significant alterations on the pharmacokinetic profile of modafinil or either stimulant, even though the absorption of modafinil was delayed for approximately one hour.Concomitant modafinil or clomipramine did not alter the pharmacokinetic profile of either drug; however, one incident of increased levels of clomipramine and its active metabolite desmethylclomipramine was reported in a patient with narcolepsy during treatment with modafinil.Data specific to NUVIGIL or modafinil drug-drug interaction potential with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors are not available.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Doxycycline Phenobarbital has been shown to shorten the half-life of doxycycline for as long as 2 weeks after barbiturate therapy is discontinued.This mechanism is probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes that metabolize the antibiotic.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Sodium valproate and valproic acid increase the secobarbital sodium serum levels; therefore, secobarbital sodium blood levels should be monitored closely and appropriate dosage adjustments made as clinically indicated.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Estradiol, Estrone, Progesterone, and Other Steroidal Hormones Pretreatment with or concurrent administration of phenobarbital may decrease the effect of estradiol by increasing its metabolism.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hepatic enzyme-inducing drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone, rifampin) can increase valproate clearance, while enzyme inhibitors (e.g., felbamate) can decrease valproate clearance.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For example, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital (or primidone) can double the clearance of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rare postmarketing reports of concurrent use of valproate and amitriptyline resulting in an increased amitriptyline level have been received.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lamotrigine In a steady-state study involving 10 healthy volunteers, the elimination half-life of lamotrigine increased from 26 to 70 hours with valproate co-administration (a 165% increase).	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Phenobarbital Valproate was found to inhibit the metabolism of phenobarbital.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Co-administration of valproate (250 mg BID for 14 days) with phenobarbital to normal subjects (n = 6) resulted in a 50% increase in half-life and a 30% decrease in plasma clearance of phenobarbital (60 mg single-dose).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The fraction of phenobarbital dose excreted unchanged increased by 50% in presence of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Rufinamide Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, rufinamide clearance was decreased by valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rufinamide concentrations were increased by <16% to 70%, dependent on concentration of valproate (with the larger increases being seen in pediatric patients at high doses or concentrations of valproate).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients stabilized on rufinamide before being prescribed valproate should begin valproate therapy at a low dose, and titrate to a clinically effective dose.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Similarly, patients on valproate should begin at a rufinamide dose lower than 10 mg/kg per day (pediatric patients) or 400 mg per day (adults).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Tolbutamide From in vitro experiments, the unbound fraction of tolbutamide was increased from 20% to 50% when added to plasma samples taken from patients treated with valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Co-administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and olanzapine (5 mg) to healthy adults (n=10) caused 15% reduction in Cmax and 35% reduction in AUC of olanzapine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Protein binding of valproate is reduced in the elderly, in patients with chronic hepatic diseases, in patients with renal impairment, and in the presence of other drugs (e.g., aspirin).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Conversely, valproate may displace certain protein-bound drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, warfarin, and tolbutamide).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For example, patients taking enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital) will clear valproate more rapidly.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dexamethasone: Steady-state trough concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide were about 56% higher when dexamethasone was coadministered with each dose of albendazole.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Praziquantel: In the fed state increased mean maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve of albendazole sulfoxide by about 50% in healthy subjects.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	In the fed state, praziquantel (40 mg/kg) increased mean maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve of albendazole sulfoxide by about 50% in healthy subjects (n = 10) compared with a separate group of subjects (n = 6) given albendazole alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Albendazole sulfoxide concentrations in bile and cystic fluid were increased (about 2-fold) in hydatid cyst patients treated with cimetidine (10 mg/kg/day) (n = 7) compared with albendazole (20 mg/kg/day) alone (n = 12).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Oral bioavailability appears to be enhanced when albendazole is coadministered with a fatty meal (estimated fat content 40 grams) as evidenced by higher (up to 5-fold on average) plasma concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide as compared to the fasted state.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, CONTRAVE should not be taken with a high-fat meal because of a resulting significant increase in bupropion and naltrexone systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During concomitant use with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel), the maximum recommended daily dose of CONTRAVE is two tablets (one tablet each morning and evening).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6: Bupropion inhibits CYP2D6 and can increase concentrations of: antidepressants, (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and many tricyclics), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide): Consider dose reduction when using with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant Treatment with CYP2B6 Inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel) can increase bupropion exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Do not exceed one tablet twice daily when taken with CYP2B6 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Studies in animals demonstrate that the acute toxicity of bupropion is enhanced by the MAOI phenelzine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CONTRAVE increased metoprolol AUC and Cmax by approximately 4- and 2-fold, respectively, relative to metoprolol alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Similar clinical drug interactions resulting in increased pharmacokinetic exposure of CYP2D6 substrates have also been observed with bupropion as a single agent with desipramine or venlafaxine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Coadministration of CONTRAVE with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isozyme including certain antidepressants (SSRIs and many tricyclics), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If CONTRAVE is added to the treatment regimen of a patient already receiving a drug metabolized by CYP2D6, the need to decrease the dose of the original medication should be considered, particularly for those concomitant medications with a narrow therapeutic index.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Inhibitors of CYP2B6: Ticlopidine and Clopidogrel: Concomitant treatment with these drugs can increase bupropion exposure but decrease hydroxybupropion exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During concomitant use with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel), the CONTRAVE daily dose should not exceed two tablets (one tablet each morning and evening).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The systemic concentrations of substrate drugs transported by OCT2 (such as amantadine, amiloride, cimetidine, dopamine, famotidine, memantine, metformin, pindolol, procainamide, ranitidine, varenicline, oxaliplatin) are likely to increase as a result of reduced renal clearance when coadministered with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food Effect on Absorption When CONTRAVE was administered with a high-fat meal, the AUC and Cmax for naltrexone increased 2.1-fold and 3.7-fold, respectively, and the AUC and Cmax for bupropion increased 1.4-fold and 1.8-fold, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	At steady state, the food effect increased AUC and Cmax for naltrexone by 1.7-fold and 1.9-fold, respectively, and increased AUC and Cmax for bupropion by 1.1-fold and 1.3-fold, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thus, CONTRAVE should not be taken with high-fat meals because of the resulting significant increases in bupropion and naltrexone systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In vitro studies suggest that paroxetine, sertraline, norfluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and nelfinavir inhibit the hydroxylation of bupropion.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The systemic concentrations of substrate drugs transported by OCT2 are likely to increase as a result of reduced renal clearance when coadministered with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	While not systematically studied, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or phenytoin may induce the metabolism of bupropion.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Chlorpheniramine may inhibit the hepatic metabolism of phenytoin, monitor phenytoin toxicity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Concomitant administration of atovaquone and indinavir did not result in any change in the steady<U+2011>state AUC and Cmax of indinavir but resulted in a decrease in the Ctrough of indinavir.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Caution should be exercised when prescribing atovaquone with indinavir due to the decrease in trough concentrations of indinavir.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dietary fat taken with atovaquone increases the rate and extent of absorption, increasing AUC 2 to 3 times and Cmax 5 times over fasting.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Products containing calcium and other multivalent cations (such as aluminum, magnesium, iron) are likely to interfere with absorption of BONIVA.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In healthy volunteers, co-administration with ranitidine resulted in a 20% increased bioavailability of ibandronate, which was not considered to be clinically relevant.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The extent of absorption is impaired by food or beverages (other than plain water).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The oral bioavailability of ibandronate is reduced by about 90% when BONIVA is administered concomitantly with a standard breakfast in comparison with bioavailability observed in fasted subjects.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drug Interaction Studies Products containing calcium and other multivalent cations (such as aluminum, magnesium, iron), including milk, food, and antacids are likely to interfere with absorption of ibandronate, which is consistent with findings in animal studies.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	H2 Blockers A pharmacokinetic interaction study in healthy volunteers demonstrated that 75 mg ranitidine (25 mg injected intravenously 90 and 15 minutes before and 30 minutes after ibandronate administration) increased the oral bioavailability of 10 mg ibandronate by about 20%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Drugs Dependent on Gastric pH for Absorption (e.g., iron salts, erlotinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, mycophenolate mofetil, ketoconazole/itraconazole) Clinical Impact: Dexlansoprazole can reduce the absorption of other drugs due to its effect on reducing intragastric acidity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Intervention: Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF): Co-administration of PPIs in healthy subjects and in transplant patients receiving MMF has been reported to reduce the exposure to the active metabolite, mycophenolic acid (MPA), possibly due to a decrease in MMF solubility at an increased gastric pH.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The clinical relevance of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving DEXILANT and MMF.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Tacrolimus Clinical Impact: Potentially increased exposure of tacrolimus, especially in transplant patients who are intermediate or poor metabolizers of CYP2C19.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Interaction with Methotrexate: Concomitant use with PPIs may elevate and/or prolong serum concentrations of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to toxicity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than three years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed in patients treated with DEXILANT.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effect on Food In food-effect studies in healthy subjects receiving DEXILANT under various fed conditions compared to fasting, increases in Cmax ranged from 12 to 55%, increases in AUC ranged from 9 to 37%, and Tmax varied (ranging from a decrease of 0.7 hours to an increase of three hours).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The mean AUC of the active metabolite of clopidogrel was reduced by approximately 9% (mean AUC ratio was 91%, with 90% CI of 86 to 97%) when DEXILANT was co-administered compared to administration of clopidogrel alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lithium generally should not be given with diuretics because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A number of drugs, including ethacrynic acid, have been shown to displace warfarin from plasma protein; a reduction in the usual anticoagulant dosage may be required in patients receiving both drugs.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lithium: Metronidazole has been reported to elevate serum lithium levels.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Phenytoin, Fosphenytoin: Concomitant administration of oral metronidazole and intravenous phenytoin was reported to result in prolongation of the half-life and reduction in the clearance of phenytoin.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cyclosporine, Tacrolimus: There are several case reports suggesting that metronidazole has the potential to increase the levels of cyclosporine and tacrolimus.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CYP3A4 Inducers and Inhibitors: Simultaneous administration of tinidazole with drugs that induce liver microsomal enzymes, i.e., CYP3A4 inducers such as phenobarbital, rifampin, phenytoin, and fosphenytoin (a pro-drug of phenytoin), may accelerate the elimination of tinidazole, decreasing the plasma level of tinidazole.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Simultaneous administration of drugs that inhibit the activity of liver microsomal enzymes, i.e., CYP3A4 inhibitors such as cimetidine and ketoconazole, may prolong the half-life and decrease the plasma clearance of tinidazole, increasing the plasma concentrations of tinidazole.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cholestyramine: Cholestyramine was shown to decrease the oral bioavailability of metronidazole by 21%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Administration of Tindamax tablets with food resulted in a delay in T max of approximately 2 hours and a decline in Cmax of approximately 10%, compared to fasted conditions.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In clinical studies, the majority of patients required a decrease in daily levodopa dose if their daily dose of levodopa had been greater than or equal to 800 mg or if patients had moderate or severe dyskinesia before beginning treatment.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	To optimize an individual patient's response, reductions in daily levodopa dose or extending the interval between doses may be necessary.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In clinical studies, the average reduction in daily levodopa dose was about 25% in those patients requiring a levodopa dose reduction (more than 58% of patients with levodopa doses above 800 mg daily required such a reduction).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When entacapone is given in conjunction with levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, such as carbidopa, plasma levels of levodopa are greater and more sustained than after administration of levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is believed that at a given frequency of levodopa administration, these more sustained plasma levels of levodopa result in more constant dopaminergic stimulation in the brain, leading to greater effects on the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When 200 mg entacapone is administered together with levodopa and carbidopa, it increases the area under the curve (AUC) of levodopa by approximately 35%, and the elimination half-life of levodopa is prolonged from 1.3 hours to 2.4 hours.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When colesevelam is coadministered with glipizide ER, maximum plasma concentration and total exposure to glipizide is reduced.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The mean percentage increase in the GLUCOTROL AUC after fluconazole administration was 56.9% (range: 35 to 81).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In studies assessing the effect of colesevelam on the pharmacokinetics of glipizide ER in healthy volunteers, reductions in glipizide AUC0<U+2013><U+221E> and Cmax of 12% and 13%, respectively were observed when colesevelam was coadministered with glipizide ER.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, GLUCOTROL should be administered at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam to ensure that colesevelam does not reduce the absorption of glipizide.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Total absorption and disposition of an oral dose was unaffected by food in normal volunteers, but absorption was delayed by about 40 minutes.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concurrent administration of lorazepam with valproate results in increased plasma concentrations and reduced clearance of lorazepam.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lorazepam dosage should be reduced to approximately 50% when co-administered with valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concurrent administration of lorazepam with probenecid may result in a more rapid onset or prolonged effect of lorazepam due to increased half-life and decreased total clearance.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lorazepam dosage needs to be reduced by approximately 50% when co-administered with probenecid.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effects of probenecid and valproate on lorazepam may be due to inhibition of glucuronidation.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Continue until methotrexate level is below 5 x 10-8 M (0.05 micromolar).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Continue Levoleucovorin for injection administration, hydration, and urinary alkalinization (pH 7.0 or greater) until the methotrexate level is below 5 x 10-8 M (0.05 micromolar).	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Delayed early methotrexate elimination and/or evidence of acute renal injury* Serum methotrexate level of 50 micromolar or more at 24 hours, or 5 micromolar or more at 48 hours after administration, OR 100% or greater increase in serum creatinine level at 24 hours after methotrexate administration (e.g., an increase from 0.5 mg/dL to a level of 1 mg/dL or more).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In addition to appropriate levoleucovorin for injection therapy, continue hydration and urinary alkalinization, and monitoring of fluid and electrolyte status, until the serum methotrexate level has fallen to below 0.05 micromolar and the renal failure has resolved.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effect of leu co vorin products on fluorouracil : Leucovorin products increase the toxicity of fluorouracil.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Leucovorin products increase the toxicities of fluorouracil.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Coadministration of ACTOS and gemfibrozil, a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, increases pioglitazone exposure approximately 3-fold.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of ACTOS is 15 mg daily when used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Strong CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g., gemfibrozil) increase pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CYP2C8 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may decrease pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Topiramate may decrease pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An inhibitor of CYP2C8 (e.g., gemfibrozil) significantly increases the exposure (area under the serum concentration-time curve or AUC) and half-life (t1/2) of pioglitazone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of ACTOS is 15 mg daily if used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An inducer of CYP2C8 (e.g., rifampin) may significantly decrease the exposure (AUC) of pioglitazone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A decrease in the exposure of pioglitazone and its active metabolites were noted with concomitant administration of pioglitazone and topiramate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food delays the Tmax to three to four hours but does not alter the extent of absorption (AUC).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In an in vitro study in human liver microsomes, inhibition of CYP2A6 hydroxylation of coumarin by fondaparinux (200 micromolar i.e., 350 mg/L) was 17 to 28%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effects of NUVIGIL on CYP3A4/5 Substrates The clearance of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A4/5 (e.g., steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, and triazolam) may be increased by NUVIGIL via induction of metabolic enzymes, which results in lower systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Blood levels of cyclosporine may be reduced when used with NUVIGIL.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effects of NUVIGIL on CYP2C19 Substrates Elimination of drugs that are substrates for CYP2C19 (e.g., phenytoin, diazepam, propranolol, omeprazole, and clomipramine) may be prolonged by NUVIGIL via inhibition of metabolic enzymes, with resultant higher systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cyclosporine: blood concentrations of cyclosporine may be reduced.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CYP2C19 substrates, such as omeprazole, phenytoin, and diazepam: exposure of these medications may be increased.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food effect on the overall bioavailability of NUVIGIL is considered minimal; however, time to reach peak concentration (tmax) may be delayed by approximately 2-4 hours in the fed state.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 250 mg resulted in a reduction in systemic exposure to midazolam by 32% after a single oral dose (5 mg) and 17% after a single intravenous dose (2 mg).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the blood levels and effectiveness of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A enzymes (e.g., steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, and triazolam) may be reduced after initiation of concomitant treatment with NUVIGIL.In a separate clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 250 mg with quetiapine (300 mg to 600 mg daily doses) resulted in a reduction in the mean systemic exposure of quetiapine by approximately 29%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 400 mg resulted in a 40% increase in exposure to omeprazole after a single oral dose (40 mg), as a result of moderate inhibition of CYP2C19 activity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Interactions with CNS Active Drugs Concomitant administration of NUVIGIL with quetiapine reduced the systemic exposure of quetiapine.Data specific to NUVIGIL drug-drug interaction potential with other CNS active drugs are not available.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant administration of modafinil with methylphenidate or dextroamphetamine produced no significant alterations on the pharmacokinetic profile of modafinil or either stimulant, even though the absorption of modafinil was delayed for approximately one hour.Concomitant modafinil or clomipramine did not alter the pharmacokinetic profile of either drug; however, one incident of increased levels of clomipramine and its active metabolite desmethylclomipramine was reported in a patient with narcolepsy during treatment with modafinil.Data specific to NUVIGIL or modafinil drug-drug interaction potential with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors are not available.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Barbiturates can induce hepatic microsomal enzymes, resulting in increased metabolism and decreased anticoagulant response of oral anticoagulants (eg, warfarin, acenocoumarol, dicumarol, and phenprocoumon).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Corticosteroids Barbiturates appear to enhance the metabolism of exogenous corticosteroids, probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Griseofulvin Phenobarbital appears to interfere with the absorption of orally administered griseofulvin, thus decreasing its blood level.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effect of the resultant decreased blood levels of griseofulvin on therapeutic response has not been established.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Doxycycline Phenobarbital has been shown to shorten the half-life of doxycycline for as long as 2 weeks after barbiturate therapy is discontinued.This mechanism is probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes that metabolize the antibiotic.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Sodium valproate and valproic acid increase the secobarbital sodium serum levels; therefore, secobarbital sodium blood levels should be monitored closely and appropriate dosage adjustments made as clinically indicated.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Estradiol, Estrone, Progesterone, and Other Steroidal Hormones Pretreatment with or concurrent administration of phenobarbital may decrease the effect of estradiol by increasing its metabolism.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hepatic enzyme-inducing drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone, rifampin) can increase valproate clearance, while enzyme inhibitors (e.g., felbamate) can decrease valproate clearance.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For example, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital (or primidone) can double the clearance of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thus, patients on monotherapy will generally have longer half-lives and higher concentrations than patients receiving polytherapy with antiepilepsy drugs.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drugs for which a potentially important interaction has been observed Aspirin A study involving the co-administration of aspirin at antipyretic doses (11 to 16 mg/kg) with valproate to pediatric patients (n = 6) revealed a decrease in protein binding and an inhibition of metabolism of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Valproate free fraction was increased 4-fold in the presence of aspirin compared to valproate alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The <U+03B2>-oxidation pathway consisting of 2-E-valproic acid, 3-OH-valproic acid, and 3-keto valproic acid was decreased from 25% of total metabolites excreted on valproate alone to 8.3% in the presence of aspirin.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Increasing the felbamate dose to 2,400 mg/day increased the mean valproate peak concentration to 133 mcg/mL (another 16% increase).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A decrease in valproate dosage may be necessary when felbamate therapy is initiated.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rifampin A study involving the administration of a single dose of valproate (7 mg/kg) 36 hours after 5 nights of daily dosing with rifampin (600 mg) revealed a 40% increase in the oral clearance of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Chlorpromazine A study involving the administration of 100 to 300 mg/day of chlorpromazine to schizophrenic patients already receiving valproate (200 mg BID) revealed a 15% increase in trough plasma levels of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drugs for which a potentially important valproate interaction has been observed Amitriptyline/Nortriptyline Administration of a single oral 50 mg dose of amitriptyline to 15 normal volunteers (10 males and 5 females) who received valproate (500 mg BID) resulted in a 21% decrease in plasma clearance of amitriptyline and a 34% decrease in the net clearance of nortriptyline.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rare postmarketing reports of concurrent use of valproate and amitriptyline resulting in an increased amitriptyline level have been received.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Consideration should be given to lowering the dose of amitriptyline/nortriptyline in the presence of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Carbamazepine/carbamazepine-10,11-Epoxide Serum levels of carbamazepine (CBZ) decreased 17% while that of carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide (CBZ-E) increased by 45% upon co-administration of valproate and CBZ to epileptic patients.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Diazepam Valproate displaces diazepam from its plasma albumin binding sites and inhibits its metabolism.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Co-administration of valproate (1,500 mg daily) increased the free fraction of diazepam (10 mg) by 90% in healthy volunteers (n = 6).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Plasma clearance and volume of distribution for free diazepam were reduced by 25% and 20%, respectively, in the presence of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Ethosuximide Valproate inhibits the metabolism of ethosuximide.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Administration of a single ethosuximide dose of 500 mg with valproate (800 to 1,600 mg/day) to healthy volunteers (n = 6) was accompanied by a 25% increase in elimination half-life of ethosuximide and a 15% decrease in its total clearance as compared to ethosuximide alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lamotrigine In a steady-state study involving 10 healthy volunteers, the elimination half-life of lamotrigine increased from 26 to 70 hours with valproate co-administration (a 165% increase).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The dose of lamotrigine should be reduced when co-administered with valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Phenobarbital Valproate was found to inhibit the metabolism of phenobarbital.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Co-administration of valproate (250 mg BID for 14 days) with phenobarbital to normal subjects (n = 6) resulted in a 50% increase in half-life and a 30% decrease in plasma clearance of phenobarbital (60 mg single-dose).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The fraction of phenobarbital dose excreted unchanged increased by 50% in presence of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Serum barbiturate concentrations should be obtained, if possible, and the barbiturate dosage decreased, if appropriate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Phenytoin Valproate displaces phenytoin from its plasma albumin binding sites and inhibits its hepatic metabolism.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Co-administration of valproate (400 mg TID) with phenytoin (250 mg) in normal volunteers (n = 7) was associated with a 60% increase in the free fraction of phenytoin.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Total plasma clearance and apparent volume of distribution of phenytoin increased 30% in the presence of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Both the clearance and apparent volume of distribution of free phenytoin were reduced by 25%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Propofol The concomitant use of valproate and propofol may lead to increased blood levels of propofol.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Reduce the dose of propofol when co-administering with valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rufinamide Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, rufinamide clearance was decreased by valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rufinamide concentrations were increased by <16% to 70%, dependent on concentration of valproate (with the larger increases being seen in pediatric patients at high doses or concentrations of valproate).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients stabilized on rufinamide before being prescribed valproate should begin valproate therapy at a low dose, and titrate to a clinically effective dose.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Similarly, patients on valproate should begin at a rufinamide dose lower than 10 mg/kg per day (pediatric patients) or 400 mg per day (adults).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Tolbutamide From in vitro experiments, the unbound fraction of tolbutamide was increased from 20% to 50% when added to plasma samples taken from patients treated with valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Warfarin In an in vitro study, valproate increased the unbound fraction of warfarin by up to 32.6%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Zidovudine In six patients who were seropositive for HIV, the clearance of zidovudine (100 mg q8h) was decreased by 38% after administration of valproate (250 or 500 mg q8h); the half-life of zidovudine was unaffected.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lorazepam Concomitant administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and lorazepam (1 mg BID) in normal male volunteers (n = 9) was accompanied by a 17% decrease in the plasma clearance of lorazepam.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Co-administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and olanzapine (5 mg) to healthy adults (n=10) caused 15% reduction in Cmax and 35% reduction in AUC of olanzapine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Protein binding of valproate is reduced in the elderly, in patients with chronic hepatic diseases, in patients with renal impairment, and in the presence of other drugs (e.g., aspirin).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Conversely, valproate may displace certain protein-bound drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, warfarin, and tolbutamide).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For example, patients taking enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital) will clear valproate more rapidly.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dexamethasone: Steady-state trough concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide were about 56% higher when dexamethasone was coadministered with each dose of albendazole.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Praziquantel: In the fed state increased mean maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve of albendazole sulfoxide by about 50% in healthy subjects.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cimetidine: Increased albendazole sulfoxide concentrations in bile and cystic fluid by about 2-fold in hydatid cyst patients.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Steady-state trough concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide were about 56% higher when 8 mg dexamethasone was co-administered with each dose of albendazole (15 mg/kg/day) in 8 neurocysticercosis patients.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In the fed state, praziquantel (40 mg/kg) increased mean maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve of albendazole sulfoxide by about 50% in healthy subjects (n = 10) compared with a separate group of subjects (n = 6) given albendazole alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Albendazole sulfoxide concentrations in bile and cystic fluid were increased (about 2-fold) in hydatid cyst patients treated with cimetidine (10 mg/kg/day) (n = 7) compared with albendazole (20 mg/kg/day) alone (n = 12).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Oral bioavailability appears to be enhanced when albendazole is coadministered with a fatty meal (estimated fat content 40 grams) as evidenced by higher (up to 5-fold on average) plasma concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide as compared to the fasted state.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, CONTRAVE should not be taken with a high-fat meal because of a resulting significant increase in bupropion and naltrexone systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During concomitant use with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel), the maximum recommended daily dose of CONTRAVE is two tablets (one tablet each morning and evening).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6: Bupropion inhibits CYP2D6 and can increase concentrations of: antidepressants, (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and many tricyclics), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide): Consider dose reduction when using with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant Treatment with CYP2B6 Inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel) can increase bupropion exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Do not exceed one tablet twice daily when taken with CYP2B6 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Studies in animals demonstrate that the acute toxicity of bupropion is enhanced by the MAOI phenelzine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CONTRAVE increased metoprolol AUC and Cmax by approximately 4- and 2-fold, respectively, relative to metoprolol alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Similar clinical drug interactions resulting in increased pharmacokinetic exposure of CYP2D6 substrates have also been observed with bupropion as a single agent with desipramine or venlafaxine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Coadministration of CONTRAVE with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isozyme including certain antidepressants (SSRIs and many tricyclics), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If CONTRAVE is added to the treatment regimen of a patient already receiving a drug metabolized by CYP2D6, the need to decrease the dose of the original medication should be considered, particularly for those concomitant medications with a narrow therapeutic index.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Inhibitors of CYP2B6: Ticlopidine and Clopidogrel: Concomitant treatment with these drugs can increase bupropion exposure but decrease hydroxybupropion exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During concomitant use with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel), the CONTRAVE daily dose should not exceed two tablets (one tablet each morning and evening).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The systemic concentrations of substrate drugs transported by OCT2 (such as amantadine, amiloride, cimetidine, dopamine, famotidine, memantine, metformin, pindolol, procainamide, ranitidine, varenicline, oxaliplatin) are likely to increase as a result of reduced renal clearance when coadministered with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food Effect on Absorption When CONTRAVE was administered with a high-fat meal, the AUC and Cmax for naltrexone increased 2.1-fold and 3.7-fold, respectively, and the AUC and Cmax for bupropion increased 1.4-fold and 1.8-fold, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Simultaneous administration of drugs that inhibit the activity of liver microsomal enzymes, i.e., CYP3A4 inhibitors such as cimetidine and ketoconazole, may prolong the half-life and decrease the plasma clearance of tinidazole, increasing the plasma concentrations of tinidazole.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	In clinical studies, the majority of patients required a decrease in daily levodopa dose if their daily dose of levodopa had been greater than or equal to 800 mg or if patients had moderate or severe dyskinesia before beginning treatment.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	To optimize an individual patient's response, reductions in daily levodopa dose or extending the interval between doses may be necessary.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In clinical studies, the average reduction in daily levodopa dose was about 25% in those patients requiring a levodopa dose reduction (more than 58% of patients with levodopa doses above 800 mg daily required such a reduction).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When entacapone is given in conjunction with levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, such as carbidopa, plasma levels of levodopa are greater and more sustained than after administration of levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is believed that at a given frequency of levodopa administration, these more sustained plasma levels of levodopa result in more constant dopaminergic stimulation in the brain, leading to greater effects on the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When 200 mg entacapone is administered together with levodopa and carbidopa, it increases the area under the curve (AUC) of levodopa by approximately 35%, and the elimination half-life of levodopa is prolonged from 1.3 hours to 2.4 hours.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When colesevelam is coadministered with glipizide ER, maximum plasma concentration and total exposure to glipizide is reduced.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The mean percentage increase in the GLUCOTROL AUC after fluconazole administration was 56.9% (range: 35 to 81).	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Lorazepam dosage should be reduced to approximately 50% when co-administered with valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concurrent administration of lorazepam with probenecid may result in a more rapid onset or prolonged effect of lorazepam due to increased half-life and decreased total clearance.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lorazepam dosage needs to be reduced by approximately 50% when co-administered with probenecid.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effects of probenecid and valproate on lorazepam may be due to inhibition of glucuronidation.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In addition to appropriate levoleucovorin for injection therapy, continue hydration and urinary alkalinization, and monitoring of fluid and electrolyte status, until the serum methotrexate level has fallen to below 0.05 micromolar and the renal failure has resolved.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Coadministration of ACTOS and gemfibrozil, a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, increases pioglitazone exposure approximately 3-fold.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of ACTOS is 15 mg daily when used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Strong CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g., gemfibrozil) increase pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	An inhibitor of CYP2C8 (e.g., gemfibrozil) significantly increases the exposure (area under the serum concentration-time curve or AUC) and half-life (t1/2) of pioglitazone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of ACTOS is 15 mg daily if used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An inducer of CYP2C8 (e.g., rifampin) may significantly decrease the exposure (AUC) of pioglitazone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A decrease in the exposure of pioglitazone and its active metabolites were noted with concomitant administration of pioglitazone and topiramate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Effects of NUVIGIL on CYP3A4/5 Substrates The clearance of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A4/5 (e.g., steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, and triazolam) may be increased by NUVIGIL via induction of metabolic enzymes, which results in lower systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Blood levels of cyclosporine may be reduced when used with NUVIGIL.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effects of NUVIGIL on CYP2C19 Substrates Elimination of drugs that are substrates for CYP2C19 (e.g., phenytoin, diazepam, propranolol, omeprazole, and clomipramine) may be prolonged by NUVIGIL via inhibition of metabolic enzymes, with resultant higher systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cyclosporine: blood concentrations of cyclosporine may be reduced.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CYP2C19 substrates, such as omeprazole, phenytoin, and diazepam: exposure of these medications may be increased.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food effect on the overall bioavailability of NUVIGIL is considered minimal; however, time to reach peak concentration (tmax) may be delayed by approximately 2-4 hours in the fed state.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 250 mg resulted in a reduction in systemic exposure to midazolam by 32% after a single oral dose (5 mg) and 17% after a single intravenous dose (2 mg).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the blood levels and effectiveness of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A enzymes (e.g., steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, and triazolam) may be reduced after initiation of concomitant treatment with NUVIGIL.In a separate clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 250 mg with quetiapine (300 mg to 600 mg daily doses) resulted in a reduction in the mean systemic exposure of quetiapine by approximately 29%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 400 mg resulted in a 40% increase in exposure to omeprazole after a single oral dose (40 mg), as a result of moderate inhibition of CYP2C19 activity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Interactions with CNS Active Drugs Concomitant administration of NUVIGIL with quetiapine reduced the systemic exposure of quetiapine.Data specific to NUVIGIL drug-drug interaction potential with other CNS active drugs are not available.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant administration of modafinil with methylphenidate or dextroamphetamine produced no significant alterations on the pharmacokinetic profile of modafinil or either stimulant, even though the absorption of modafinil was delayed for approximately one hour.Concomitant modafinil or clomipramine did not alter the pharmacokinetic profile of either drug; however, one incident of increased levels of clomipramine and its active metabolite desmethylclomipramine was reported in a patient with narcolepsy during treatment with modafinil.Data specific to NUVIGIL or modafinil drug-drug interaction potential with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors are not available.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Barbiturates can induce hepatic microsomal enzymes, resulting in increased metabolism and decreased anticoagulant response of oral anticoagulants (eg, warfarin, acenocoumarol, dicumarol, and phenprocoumon).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Corticosteroids Barbiturates appear to enhance the metabolism of exogenous corticosteroids, probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Griseofulvin Phenobarbital appears to interfere with the absorption of orally administered griseofulvin, thus decreasing its blood level.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effect of the resultant decreased blood levels of griseofulvin on therapeutic response has not been established.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Doxycycline Phenobarbital has been shown to shorten the half-life of doxycycline for as long as 2 weeks after barbiturate therapy is discontinued.This mechanism is probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes that metabolize the antibiotic.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Sodium valproate and valproic acid increase the secobarbital sodium serum levels; therefore, secobarbital sodium blood levels should be monitored closely and appropriate dosage adjustments made as clinically indicated.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Estradiol, Estrone, Progesterone, and Other Steroidal Hormones Pretreatment with or concurrent administration of phenobarbital may decrease the effect of estradiol by increasing its metabolism.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hepatic enzyme-inducing drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone, rifampin) can increase valproate clearance, while enzyme inhibitors (e.g., felbamate) can decrease valproate clearance.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For example, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital (or primidone) can double the clearance of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thus, patients on monotherapy will generally have longer half-lives and higher concentrations than patients receiving polytherapy with antiepilepsy drugs.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Increasing the felbamate dose to 2,400 mg/day increased the mean valproate peak concentration to 133 mcg/mL (another 16% increase).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A decrease in valproate dosage may be necessary when felbamate therapy is initiated.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rifampin A study involving the administration of a single dose of valproate (7 mg/kg) 36 hours after 5 nights of daily dosing with rifampin (600 mg) revealed a 40% increase in the oral clearance of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rare postmarketing reports of concurrent use of valproate and amitriptyline resulting in an increased amitriptyline level have been received.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lamotrigine In a steady-state study involving 10 healthy volunteers, the elimination half-life of lamotrigine increased from 26 to 70 hours with valproate co-administration (a 165% increase).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The dose of lamotrigine should be reduced when co-administered with valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Phenobarbital Valproate was found to inhibit the metabolism of phenobarbital.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Co-administration of valproate (250 mg BID for 14 days) with phenobarbital to normal subjects (n = 6) resulted in a 50% increase in half-life and a 30% decrease in plasma clearance of phenobarbital (60 mg single-dose).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The fraction of phenobarbital dose excreted unchanged increased by 50% in presence of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Serum barbiturate concentrations should be obtained, if possible, and the barbiturate dosage decreased, if appropriate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Rufinamide Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, rufinamide clearance was decreased by valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rufinamide concentrations were increased by <16% to 70%, dependent on concentration of valproate (with the larger increases being seen in pediatric patients at high doses or concentrations of valproate).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients stabilized on rufinamide before being prescribed valproate should begin valproate therapy at a low dose, and titrate to a clinically effective dose.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Similarly, patients on valproate should begin at a rufinamide dose lower than 10 mg/kg per day (pediatric patients) or 400 mg per day (adults).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Tolbutamide From in vitro experiments, the unbound fraction of tolbutamide was increased from 20% to 50% when added to plasma samples taken from patients treated with valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Lorazepam Concomitant administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and lorazepam (1 mg BID) in normal male volunteers (n = 9) was accompanied by a 17% decrease in the plasma clearance of lorazepam.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Co-administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and olanzapine (5 mg) to healthy adults (n=10) caused 15% reduction in Cmax and 35% reduction in AUC of olanzapine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Protein binding of valproate is reduced in the elderly, in patients with chronic hepatic diseases, in patients with renal impairment, and in the presence of other drugs (e.g., aspirin).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Conversely, valproate may displace certain protein-bound drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, warfarin, and tolbutamide).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For example, patients taking enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital) will clear valproate more rapidly.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dexamethasone: Steady-state trough concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide were about 56% higher when dexamethasone was coadministered with each dose of albendazole.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Praziquantel: In the fed state increased mean maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve of albendazole sulfoxide by about 50% in healthy subjects.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	In the fed state, praziquantel (40 mg/kg) increased mean maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve of albendazole sulfoxide by about 50% in healthy subjects (n = 10) compared with a separate group of subjects (n = 6) given albendazole alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Albendazole sulfoxide concentrations in bile and cystic fluid were increased (about 2-fold) in hydatid cyst patients treated with cimetidine (10 mg/kg/day) (n = 7) compared with albendazole (20 mg/kg/day) alone (n = 12).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Oral bioavailability appears to be enhanced when albendazole is coadministered with a fatty meal (estimated fat content 40 grams) as evidenced by higher (up to 5-fold on average) plasma concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide as compared to the fasted state.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, CONTRAVE should not be taken with a high-fat meal because of a resulting significant increase in bupropion and naltrexone systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During concomitant use with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel), the maximum recommended daily dose of CONTRAVE is two tablets (one tablet each morning and evening).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6: Bupropion inhibits CYP2D6 and can increase concentrations of: antidepressants, (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and many tricyclics), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide): Consider dose reduction when using with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant Treatment with CYP2B6 Inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel) can increase bupropion exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Do not exceed one tablet twice daily when taken with CYP2B6 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Studies in animals demonstrate that the acute toxicity of bupropion is enhanced by the MAOI phenelzine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CONTRAVE increased metoprolol AUC and Cmax by approximately 4- and 2-fold, respectively, relative to metoprolol alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Similar clinical drug interactions resulting in increased pharmacokinetic exposure of CYP2D6 substrates have also been observed with bupropion as a single agent with desipramine or venlafaxine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Coadministration of CONTRAVE with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isozyme including certain antidepressants (SSRIs and many tricyclics), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If CONTRAVE is added to the treatment regimen of a patient already receiving a drug metabolized by CYP2D6, the need to decrease the dose of the original medication should be considered, particularly for those concomitant medications with a narrow therapeutic index.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Inhibitors of CYP2B6: Ticlopidine and Clopidogrel: Concomitant treatment with these drugs can increase bupropion exposure but decrease hydroxybupropion exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During concomitant use with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel), the CONTRAVE daily dose should not exceed two tablets (one tablet each morning and evening).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The systemic concentrations of substrate drugs transported by OCT2 (such as amantadine, amiloride, cimetidine, dopamine, famotidine, memantine, metformin, pindolol, procainamide, ranitidine, varenicline, oxaliplatin) are likely to increase as a result of reduced renal clearance when coadministered with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food Effect on Absorption When CONTRAVE was administered with a high-fat meal, the AUC and Cmax for naltrexone increased 2.1-fold and 3.7-fold, respectively, and the AUC and Cmax for bupropion increased 1.4-fold and 1.8-fold, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	At steady state, the food effect increased AUC and Cmax for naltrexone by 1.7-fold and 1.9-fold, respectively, and increased AUC and Cmax for bupropion by 1.1-fold and 1.3-fold, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thus, CONTRAVE should not be taken with high-fat meals because of the resulting significant increases in bupropion and naltrexone systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In vitro studies suggest that paroxetine, sertraline, norfluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and nelfinavir inhibit the hydroxylation of bupropion.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The systemic concentrations of substrate drugs transported by OCT2 are likely to increase as a result of reduced renal clearance when coadministered with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	While not systematically studied, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or phenytoin may induce the metabolism of bupropion.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Chlorpheniramine may inhibit the hepatic metabolism of phenytoin, monitor phenytoin toxicity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Cimetidine Plus Probenecid: Acyclovir Cmax and AUC following a single dose of VALTREX (1 gram) increased by 30% and 78%, respectively, after a combination of cimetidine and probenecid, primarily due to a reduction in renal clearance of acyclovir.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Probenecid: Acyclovir Cmax and AUC following a single dose of VALTREX (1 gram) increased by 22% and 49%, respectively, after probenecid (1 gram).	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Concomitant administration of atovaquone and indinavir did not result in any change in the steady<U+2011>state AUC and Cmax of indinavir but resulted in a decrease in the Ctrough of indinavir.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Caution should be exercised when prescribing atovaquone with indinavir due to the decrease in trough concentrations of indinavir.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dietary fat taken with atovaquone increases the rate and extent of absorption, increasing AUC 2 to 3 times and Cmax 5 times over fasting.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rifampin/Rifabutin: Concomitant administration of rifampin or rifabutin is known to reduce atovaquone concentrations by approximately 50% and 34%, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	After oral administration of ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, the mean plasma concentration of orally inhaled mometasone furoate increased.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Caution should be exercised when considering the coadministration of ASMANEX HFA with ketoconazole, and other known strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, cobicistat-containing products, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) because adverse effects related to increased systemic exposure to mometasone furoate may occur.

5	Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed in patients treated with DEXILANT.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Simultaneous administration of drugs that inhibit the activity of liver microsomal enzymes, i.e., CYP3A4 inhibitors such as cimetidine and ketoconazole, may prolong the half-life and decrease the plasma clearance of tinidazole, increasing the plasma concentrations of tinidazole.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cholestyramine: Cholestyramine was shown to decrease the oral bioavailability of metronidazole by 21%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Administration of Tindamax tablets with food resulted in a delay in T max of approximately 2 hours and a decline in Cmax of approximately 10%, compared to fasted conditions.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In clinical studies, the majority of patients required a decrease in daily levodopa dose if their daily dose of levodopa had been greater than or equal to 800 mg or if patients had moderate or severe dyskinesia before beginning treatment.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	To optimize an individual patient's response, reductions in daily levodopa dose or extending the interval between doses may be necessary.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In clinical studies, the average reduction in daily levodopa dose was about 25% in those patients requiring a levodopa dose reduction (more than 58% of patients with levodopa doses above 800 mg daily required such a reduction).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When entacapone is given in conjunction with levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, such as carbidopa, plasma levels of levodopa are greater and more sustained than after administration of levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is believed that at a given frequency of levodopa administration, these more sustained plasma levels of levodopa result in more constant dopaminergic stimulation in the brain, leading to greater effects on the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When 200 mg entacapone is administered together with levodopa and carbidopa, it increases the area under the curve (AUC) of levodopa by approximately 35%, and the elimination half-life of levodopa is prolonged from 1.3 hours to 2.4 hours.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When colesevelam is coadministered with glipizide ER, maximum plasma concentration and total exposure to glipizide is reduced.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The mean percentage increase in the GLUCOTROL AUC after fluconazole administration was 56.9% (range: 35 to 81).	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Therefore, GLUCOTROL should be administered at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam to ensure that colesevelam does not reduce the absorption of glipizide.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Total absorption and disposition of an oral dose was unaffected by food in normal volunteers, but absorption was delayed by about 40 minutes.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concurrent administration of lorazepam with valproate results in increased plasma concentrations and reduced clearance of lorazepam.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lorazepam dosage should be reduced to approximately 50% when co-administered with valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concurrent administration of lorazepam with probenecid may result in a more rapid onset or prolonged effect of lorazepam due to increased half-life and decreased total clearance.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lorazepam dosage needs to be reduced by approximately 50% when co-administered with probenecid.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effects of probenecid and valproate on lorazepam may be due to inhibition of glucuronidation.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Continue until methotrexate level is below 5 x 10-8 M (0.05 micromolar).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Continue Levoleucovorin for injection administration, hydration, and urinary alkalinization (pH 7.0 or greater) until the methotrexate level is below 5 x 10-8 M (0.05 micromolar).	Pharmacokinetic interaction

Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In addition to appropriate levoleucovorin for injection therapy, continue hydration and urinary alkalinization, and monitoring of fluid and electrolyte status, until the serum methotrexate level has fallen to below 0.05 micromolar and the renal failure has resolved.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effect of leu co vorin products on fluorouracil : Leucovorin products increase the toxicity of fluorouracil.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Leucovorin products increase the toxicities of fluorouracil.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Coadministration of ACTOS and gemfibrozil, a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, increases pioglitazone exposure approximately 3-fold.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of ACTOS is 15 mg daily when used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Strong CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g., gemfibrozil) increase pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CYP2C8 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may decrease pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Topiramate may decrease pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An inhibitor of CYP2C8 (e.g., gemfibrozil) significantly increases the exposure (area under the serum concentration-time curve or AUC) and half-life (t1/2) of pioglitazone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of ACTOS is 15 mg daily if used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An inducer of CYP2C8 (e.g., rifampin) may significantly decrease the exposure (AUC) of pioglitazone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A decrease in the exposure of pioglitazone and its active metabolites were noted with concomitant administration of pioglitazone and topiramate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food delays the Tmax to three to four hours but does not alter the extent of absorption (AUC).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In an in vitro study in human liver microsomes, inhibition of CYP2A6 hydroxylation of coumarin by fondaparinux (200 micromolar i.e., 350 mg/L) was 17 to 28%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effects of NUVIGIL on CYP3A4/5 Substrates The clearance of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A4/5 (e.g., steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, and triazolam) may be increased by NUVIGIL via induction of metabolic enzymes, which results in lower systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Blood levels of cyclosporine may be reduced when used with NUVIGIL.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effects of NUVIGIL on CYP2C19 Substrates Elimination of drugs that are substrates for CYP2C19 (e.g., phenytoin, diazepam, propranolol, omeprazole, and clomipramine) may be prolonged by NUVIGIL via inhibition of metabolic enzymes, with resultant higher systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cyclosporine: blood concentrations of cyclosporine may be reduced.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CYP2C19 substrates, such as omeprazole, phenytoin, and diazepam: exposure of these medications may be increased.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food effect on the overall bioavailability of NUVIGIL is considered minimal; however, time to reach peak concentration (tmax) may be delayed by approximately 2-4 hours in the fed state.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 250 mg resulted in a reduction in systemic exposure to midazolam by 32% after a single oral dose (5 mg) and 17% after a single intravenous dose (2 mg).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the blood levels and effectiveness of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A enzymes (e.g., steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, and triazolam) may be reduced after initiation of concomitant treatment with NUVIGIL.In a separate clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 250 mg with quetiapine (300 mg to 600 mg daily doses) resulted in a reduction in the mean systemic exposure of quetiapine by approximately 29%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 400 mg resulted in a 40% increase in exposure to omeprazole after a single oral dose (40 mg), as a result of moderate inhibition of CYP2C19 activity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Interactions with CNS Active Drugs Concomitant administration of NUVIGIL with quetiapine reduced the systemic exposure of quetiapine.Data specific to NUVIGIL drug-drug interaction potential with other CNS active drugs are not available.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant administration of modafinil with methylphenidate or dextroamphetamine produced no significant alterations on the pharmacokinetic profile of modafinil or either stimulant, even though the absorption of modafinil was delayed for approximately one hour.Concomitant modafinil or clomipramine did not alter the pharmacokinetic profile of either drug; however, one incident of increased levels of clomipramine and its active metabolite desmethylclomipramine was reported in a patient with narcolepsy during treatment with modafinil.Data specific to NUVIGIL or modafinil drug-drug interaction potential with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors are not available.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Barbiturates can induce hepatic microsomal enzymes, resulting in increased metabolism and decreased anticoagulant response of oral anticoagulants (eg, warfarin, acenocoumarol, dicumarol, and phenprocoumon).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Corticosteroids Barbiturates appear to enhance the metabolism of exogenous corticosteroids, probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Griseofulvin Phenobarbital appears to interfere with the absorption of orally administered griseofulvin, thus decreasing its blood level.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effect of the resultant decreased blood levels of griseofulvin on therapeutic response has not been established.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Doxycycline Phenobarbital has been shown to shorten the half-life of doxycycline for as long as 2 weeks after barbiturate therapy is discontinued.This mechanism is probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes that metabolize the antibiotic.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Sodium valproate and valproic acid increase the secobarbital sodium serum levels; therefore, secobarbital sodium blood levels should be monitored closely and appropriate dosage adjustments made as clinically indicated.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Estradiol, Estrone, Progesterone, and Other Steroidal Hormones Pretreatment with or concurrent administration of phenobarbital may decrease the effect of estradiol by increasing its metabolism.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hepatic enzyme-inducing drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone, rifampin) can increase valproate clearance, while enzyme inhibitors (e.g., felbamate) can decrease valproate clearance.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For example, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital (or primidone) can double the clearance of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thus, patients on monotherapy will generally have longer half-lives and higher concentrations than patients receiving polytherapy with antiepilepsy drugs.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Increasing the felbamate dose to 2,400 mg/day increased the mean valproate peak concentration to 133 mcg/mL (another 16% increase).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A decrease in valproate dosage may be necessary when felbamate therapy is initiated.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rifampin A study involving the administration of a single dose of valproate (7 mg/kg) 36 hours after 5 nights of daily dosing with rifampin (600 mg) revealed a 40% increase in the oral clearance of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rare postmarketing reports of concurrent use of valproate and amitriptyline resulting in an increased amitriptyline level have been received.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Consideration should be given to lowering the dose of amitriptyline/nortriptyline in the presence of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Carbamazepine/carbamazepine-10,11-Epoxide Serum levels of carbamazepine (CBZ) decreased 17% while that of carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide (CBZ-E) increased by 45% upon co-administration of valproate and CBZ to epileptic patients.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Rufinamide Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, rufinamide clearance was decreased by valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rufinamide concentrations were increased by <16% to 70%, dependent on concentration of valproate (with the larger increases being seen in pediatric patients at high doses or concentrations of valproate).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients stabilized on rufinamide before being prescribed valproate should begin valproate therapy at a low dose, and titrate to a clinically effective dose.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Similarly, patients on valproate should begin at a rufinamide dose lower than 10 mg/kg per day (pediatric patients) or 400 mg per day (adults).	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Zidovudine In six patients who were seropositive for HIV, the clearance of zidovudine (100 mg q8h) was decreased by 38% after administration of valproate (250 or 500 mg q8h); the half-life of zidovudine was unaffected.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lorazepam Concomitant administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and lorazepam (1 mg BID) in normal male volunteers (n = 9) was accompanied by a 17% decrease in the plasma clearance of lorazepam.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Co-administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and olanzapine (5 mg) to healthy adults (n=10) caused 15% reduction in Cmax and 35% reduction in AUC of olanzapine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Protein binding of valproate is reduced in the elderly, in patients with chronic hepatic diseases, in patients with renal impairment, and in the presence of other drugs (e.g., aspirin).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Conversely, valproate may displace certain protein-bound drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, warfarin, and tolbutamide).	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Albendazole sulfoxide concentrations in bile and cystic fluid were increased (about 2-fold) in hydatid cyst patients treated with cimetidine (10 mg/kg/day) (n = 7) compared with albendazole (20 mg/kg/day) alone (n = 12).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Oral bioavailability appears to be enhanced when albendazole is coadministered with a fatty meal (estimated fat content 40 grams) as evidenced by higher (up to 5-fold on average) plasma concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide as compared to the fasted state.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, CONTRAVE should not be taken with a high-fat meal because of a resulting significant increase in bupropion and naltrexone systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During concomitant use with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel), the maximum recommended daily dose of CONTRAVE is two tablets (one tablet each morning and evening).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6: Bupropion inhibits CYP2D6 and can increase concentrations of: antidepressants, (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and many tricyclics), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide): Consider dose reduction when using with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant Treatment with CYP2B6 Inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel) can increase bupropion exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Do not exceed one tablet twice daily when taken with CYP2B6 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Studies in animals demonstrate that the acute toxicity of bupropion is enhanced by the MAOI phenelzine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CONTRAVE increased metoprolol AUC and Cmax by approximately 4- and 2-fold, respectively, relative to metoprolol alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Similar clinical drug interactions resulting in increased pharmacokinetic exposure of CYP2D6 substrates have also been observed with bupropion as a single agent with desipramine or venlafaxine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Coadministration of CONTRAVE with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isozyme including certain antidepressants (SSRIs and many tricyclics), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If CONTRAVE is added to the treatment regimen of a patient already receiving a drug metabolized by CYP2D6, the need to decrease the dose of the original medication should be considered, particularly for those concomitant medications with a narrow therapeutic index.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Inhibitors of CYP2B6: Ticlopidine and Clopidogrel: Concomitant treatment with these drugs can increase bupropion exposure but decrease hydroxybupropion exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During concomitant use with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel), the CONTRAVE daily dose should not exceed two tablets (one tablet each morning and evening).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The systemic concentrations of substrate drugs transported by OCT2 (such as amantadine, amiloride, cimetidine, dopamine, famotidine, memantine, metformin, pindolol, procainamide, ranitidine, varenicline, oxaliplatin) are likely to increase as a result of reduced renal clearance when coadministered with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food Effect on Absorption When CONTRAVE was administered with a high-fat meal, the AUC and Cmax for naltrexone increased 2.1-fold and 3.7-fold, respectively, and the AUC and Cmax for bupropion increased 1.4-fold and 1.8-fold, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	At steady state, the food effect increased AUC and Cmax for naltrexone by 1.7-fold and 1.9-fold, respectively, and increased AUC and Cmax for bupropion by 1.1-fold and 1.3-fold, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thus, CONTRAVE should not be taken with high-fat meals because of the resulting significant increases in bupropion and naltrexone systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In vitro studies suggest that paroxetine, sertraline, norfluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and nelfinavir inhibit the hydroxylation of bupropion.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	It is believed that at a given frequency of levodopa administration, these more sustained plasma levels of levodopa result in more constant dopaminergic stimulation in the brain, leading to greater effects on the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When 200 mg entacapone is administered together with levodopa and carbidopa, it increases the area under the curve (AUC) of levodopa by approximately 35%, and the elimination half-life of levodopa is prolonged from 1.3 hours to 2.4 hours.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When colesevelam is coadministered with glipizide ER, maximum plasma concentration and total exposure to glipizide is reduced.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The mean percentage increase in the GLUCOTROL AUC after fluconazole administration was 56.9% (range: 35 to 81).	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Lorazepam dosage should be reduced to approximately 50% when co-administered with valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concurrent administration of lorazepam with probenecid may result in a more rapid onset or prolonged effect of lorazepam due to increased half-life and decreased total clearance.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lorazepam dosage needs to be reduced by approximately 50% when co-administered with probenecid.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	An inhibitor of CYP2C8 (e.g., gemfibrozil) significantly increases the exposure (area under the serum concentration-time curve or AUC) and half-life (t1/2) of pioglitazone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of ACTOS is 15 mg daily if used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An inducer of CYP2C8 (e.g., rifampin) may significantly decrease the exposure (AUC) of pioglitazone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Effects of NUVIGIL on CYP3A4/5 Substrates The clearance of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A4/5 (e.g., steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, and triazolam) may be increased by NUVIGIL via induction of metabolic enzymes, which results in lower systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Blood levels of cyclosporine may be reduced when used with NUVIGIL.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effects of NUVIGIL on CYP2C19 Substrates Elimination of drugs that are substrates for CYP2C19 (e.g., phenytoin, diazepam, propranolol, omeprazole, and clomipramine) may be prolonged by NUVIGIL via inhibition of metabolic enzymes, with resultant higher systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cyclosporine: blood concentrations of cyclosporine may be reduced.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CYP2C19 substrates, such as omeprazole, phenytoin, and diazepam: exposure of these medications may be increased.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food effect on the overall bioavailability of NUVIGIL is considered minimal; however, time to reach peak concentration (tmax) may be delayed by approximately 2-4 hours in the fed state.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 250 mg resulted in a reduction in systemic exposure to midazolam by 32% after a single oral dose (5 mg) and 17% after a single intravenous dose (2 mg).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the blood levels and effectiveness of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A enzymes (e.g., steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, and triazolam) may be reduced after initiation of concomitant treatment with NUVIGIL.In a separate clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 250 mg with quetiapine (300 mg to 600 mg daily doses) resulted in a reduction in the mean systemic exposure of quetiapine by approximately 29%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 400 mg resulted in a 40% increase in exposure to omeprazole after a single oral dose (40 mg), as a result of moderate inhibition of CYP2C19 activity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Concomitant administration of modafinil with methylphenidate or dextroamphetamine produced no significant alterations on the pharmacokinetic profile of modafinil or either stimulant, even though the absorption of modafinil was delayed for approximately one hour.Concomitant modafinil or clomipramine did not alter the pharmacokinetic profile of either drug; however, one incident of increased levels of clomipramine and its active metabolite desmethylclomipramine was reported in a patient with narcolepsy during treatment with modafinil.Data specific to NUVIGIL or modafinil drug-drug interaction potential with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors are not available.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Corticosteroids Barbiturates appear to enhance the metabolism of exogenous corticosteroids, probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Griseofulvin Phenobarbital appears to interfere with the absorption of orally administered griseofulvin, thus decreasing its blood level.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effect of the resultant decreased blood levels of griseofulvin on therapeutic response has not been established.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Doxycycline Phenobarbital has been shown to shorten the half-life of doxycycline for as long as 2 weeks after barbiturate therapy is discontinued.This mechanism is probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes that metabolize the antibiotic.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Sodium valproate and valproic acid increase the secobarbital sodium serum levels; therefore, secobarbital sodium blood levels should be monitored closely and appropriate dosage adjustments made as clinically indicated.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Estradiol, Estrone, Progesterone, and Other Steroidal Hormones Pretreatment with or concurrent administration of phenobarbital may decrease the effect of estradiol by increasing its metabolism.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hepatic enzyme-inducing drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone, rifampin) can increase valproate clearance, while enzyme inhibitors (e.g., felbamate) can decrease valproate clearance.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For example, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital (or primidone) can double the clearance of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Increasing the felbamate dose to 2,400 mg/day increased the mean valproate peak concentration to 133 mcg/mL (another 16% increase).	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	In the fed state, praziquantel (40 mg/kg) increased mean maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve of albendazole sulfoxide by about 50% in healthy subjects (n = 10) compared with a separate group of subjects (n = 6) given albendazole alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Albendazole sulfoxide concentrations in bile and cystic fluid were increased (about 2-fold) in hydatid cyst patients treated with cimetidine (10 mg/kg/day) (n = 7) compared with albendazole (20 mg/kg/day) alone (n = 12).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Oral bioavailability appears to be enhanced when albendazole is coadministered with a fatty meal (estimated fat content 40 grams) as evidenced by higher (up to 5-fold on average) plasma concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide as compared to the fasted state.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, CONTRAVE should not be taken with a high-fat meal because of a resulting significant increase in bupropion and naltrexone systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During concomitant use with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel), the maximum recommended daily dose of CONTRAVE is two tablets (one tablet each morning and evening).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6: Bupropion inhibits CYP2D6 and can increase concentrations of: antidepressants, (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and many tricyclics), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide): Consider dose reduction when using with CONTRAVE.

5	CONTRAVE increased metoprolol AUC and Cmax by approximately 4- and 2-fold, respectively, relative to metoprolol alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Similar clinical drug interactions resulting in increased pharmacokinetic exposure of CYP2D6 substrates have also been observed with bupropion as a single agent with desipramine or venlafaxine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Coadministration of CONTRAVE with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isozyme including certain antidepressants (SSRIs and many tricyclics), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If CONTRAVE is added to the treatment regimen of a patient already receiving a drug metabolized by CYP2D6, the need to decrease the dose of the original medication should be considered, particularly for those concomitant medications with a narrow therapeutic index.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Inhibitors of CYP2B6: Ticlopidine and Clopidogrel: Concomitant treatment with these drugs can increase bupropion exposure but decrease hydroxybupropion exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	The systemic concentrations of substrate drugs transported by OCT2 (such as amantadine, amiloride, cimetidine, dopamine, famotidine, memantine, metformin, pindolol, procainamide, ranitidine, varenicline, oxaliplatin) are likely to increase as a result of reduced renal clearance when coadministered with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food Effect on Absorption When CONTRAVE was administered with a high-fat meal, the AUC and Cmax for naltrexone increased 2.1-fold and 3.7-fold, respectively, and the AUC and Cmax for bupropion increased 1.4-fold and 1.8-fold, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	At steady state, the food effect increased AUC and Cmax for naltrexone by 1.7-fold and 1.9-fold, respectively, and increased AUC and Cmax for bupropion by 1.1-fold and 1.3-fold, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thus, CONTRAVE should not be taken with high-fat meals because of the resulting significant increases in bupropion and naltrexone systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In vitro studies suggest that paroxetine, sertraline, norfluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and nelfinavir inhibit the hydroxylation of bupropion.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The systemic concentrations of substrate drugs transported by OCT2 are likely to increase as a result of reduced renal clearance when coadministered with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	While not systematically studied, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or phenytoin may induce the metabolism of bupropion.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Chlorpheniramine may inhibit the hepatic metabolism of phenytoin, monitor phenytoin toxicity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Cimetidine Plus Probenecid: Acyclovir Cmax and AUC following a single dose of VALTREX (1 gram) increased by 30% and 78%, respectively, after a combination of cimetidine and probenecid, primarily due to a reduction in renal clearance of acyclovir.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Concomitant administration of atovaquone and indinavir did not result in any change in the steady<U+2011>state AUC and Cmax of indinavir but resulted in a decrease in the Ctrough of indinavir.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Caution should be exercised when prescribing atovaquone with indinavir due to the decrease in trough concentrations of indinavir.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dietary fat taken with atovaquone increases the rate and extent of absorption, increasing AUC 2 to 3 times and Cmax 5 times over fasting.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rifampin/Rifabutin: Concomitant administration of rifampin or rifabutin is known to reduce atovaquone concentrations by approximately 50% and 34%, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed in patients treated with DEXILANT.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Simultaneous administration of drugs that inhibit the activity of liver microsomal enzymes, i.e., CYP3A4 inhibitors such as cimetidine and ketoconazole, may prolong the half-life and decrease the plasma clearance of tinidazole, increasing the plasma concentrations of tinidazole.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cholestyramine: Cholestyramine was shown to decrease the oral bioavailability of metronidazole by 21%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Administration of Tindamax tablets with food resulted in a delay in T max of approximately 2 hours and a decline in Cmax of approximately 10%, compared to fasted conditions.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In clinical studies, the majority of patients required a decrease in daily levodopa dose if their daily dose of levodopa had been greater than or equal to 800 mg or if patients had moderate or severe dyskinesia before beginning treatment.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	To optimize an individual patient's response, reductions in daily levodopa dose or extending the interval between doses may be necessary.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In clinical studies, the average reduction in daily levodopa dose was about 25% in those patients requiring a levodopa dose reduction (more than 58% of patients with levodopa doses above 800 mg daily required such a reduction).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When entacapone is given in conjunction with levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, such as carbidopa, plasma levels of levodopa are greater and more sustained than after administration of levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is believed that at a given frequency of levodopa administration, these more sustained plasma levels of levodopa result in more constant dopaminergic stimulation in the brain, leading to greater effects on the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When 200 mg entacapone is administered together with levodopa and carbidopa, it increases the area under the curve (AUC) of levodopa by approximately 35%, and the elimination half-life of levodopa is prolonged from 1.3 hours to 2.4 hours.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When colesevelam is coadministered with glipizide ER, maximum plasma concentration and total exposure to glipizide is reduced.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The mean percentage increase in the GLUCOTROL AUC after fluconazole administration was 56.9% (range: 35 to 81).	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Lorazepam dosage should be reduced to approximately 50% when co-administered with valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concurrent administration of lorazepam with probenecid may result in a more rapid onset or prolonged effect of lorazepam due to increased half-life and decreased total clearance.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lorazepam dosage needs to be reduced by approximately 50% when co-administered with probenecid.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effects of probenecid and valproate on lorazepam may be due to inhibition of glucuronidation.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In addition to appropriate levoleucovorin for injection therapy, continue hydration and urinary alkalinization, and monitoring of fluid and electrolyte status, until the serum methotrexate level has fallen to below 0.05 micromolar and the renal failure has resolved.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effect of leu co vorin products on fluorouracil : Leucovorin products increase the toxicity of fluorouracil.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Leucovorin products increase the toxicities of fluorouracil.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Coadministration of ACTOS and gemfibrozil, a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, increases pioglitazone exposure approximately 3-fold.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of ACTOS is 15 mg daily when used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Strong CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g., gemfibrozil) increase pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CYP2C8 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may decrease pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Topiramate may decrease pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An inhibitor of CYP2C8 (e.g., gemfibrozil) significantly increases the exposure (area under the serum concentration-time curve or AUC) and half-life (t1/2) of pioglitazone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of ACTOS is 15 mg daily if used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An inducer of CYP2C8 (e.g., rifampin) may significantly decrease the exposure (AUC) of pioglitazone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A decrease in the exposure of pioglitazone and its active metabolites were noted with concomitant administration of pioglitazone and topiramate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food delays the Tmax to three to four hours but does not alter the extent of absorption (AUC).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In an in vitro study in human liver microsomes, inhibition of CYP2A6 hydroxylation of coumarin by fondaparinux (200 micromolar i.e., 350 mg/L) was 17 to 28%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effects of NUVIGIL on CYP3A4/5 Substrates The clearance of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A4/5 (e.g., steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, and triazolam) may be increased by NUVIGIL via induction of metabolic enzymes, which results in lower systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Blood levels of cyclosporine may be reduced when used with NUVIGIL.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effects of NUVIGIL on CYP2C19 Substrates Elimination of drugs that are substrates for CYP2C19 (e.g., phenytoin, diazepam, propranolol, omeprazole, and clomipramine) may be prolonged by NUVIGIL via inhibition of metabolic enzymes, with resultant higher systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cyclosporine: blood concentrations of cyclosporine may be reduced.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CYP2C19 substrates, such as omeprazole, phenytoin, and diazepam: exposure of these medications may be increased.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food effect on the overall bioavailability of NUVIGIL is considered minimal; however, time to reach peak concentration (tmax) may be delayed by approximately 2-4 hours in the fed state.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 250 mg resulted in a reduction in systemic exposure to midazolam by 32% after a single oral dose (5 mg) and 17% after a single intravenous dose (2 mg).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the blood levels and effectiveness of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A enzymes (e.g., steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, and triazolam) may be reduced after initiation of concomitant treatment with NUVIGIL.In a separate clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 250 mg with quetiapine (300 mg to 600 mg daily doses) resulted in a reduction in the mean systemic exposure of quetiapine by approximately 29%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 400 mg resulted in a 40% increase in exposure to omeprazole after a single oral dose (40 mg), as a result of moderate inhibition of CYP2C19 activity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Interactions with CNS Active Drugs Concomitant administration of NUVIGIL with quetiapine reduced the systemic exposure of quetiapine.Data specific to NUVIGIL drug-drug interaction potential with other CNS active drugs are not available.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant administration of modafinil with methylphenidate or dextroamphetamine produced no significant alterations on the pharmacokinetic profile of modafinil or either stimulant, even though the absorption of modafinil was delayed for approximately one hour.Concomitant modafinil or clomipramine did not alter the pharmacokinetic profile of either drug; however, one incident of increased levels of clomipramine and its active metabolite desmethylclomipramine was reported in a patient with narcolepsy during treatment with modafinil.Data specific to NUVIGIL or modafinil drug-drug interaction potential with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors are not available.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Barbiturates can induce hepatic microsomal enzymes, resulting in increased metabolism and decreased anticoagulant response of oral anticoagulants (eg, warfarin, acenocoumarol, dicumarol, and phenprocoumon).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Corticosteroids Barbiturates appear to enhance the metabolism of exogenous corticosteroids, probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Griseofulvin Phenobarbital appears to interfere with the absorption of orally administered griseofulvin, thus decreasing its blood level.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effect of the resultant decreased blood levels of griseofulvin on therapeutic response has not been established.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Doxycycline Phenobarbital has been shown to shorten the half-life of doxycycline for as long as 2 weeks after barbiturate therapy is discontinued.This mechanism is probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes that metabolize the antibiotic.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Sodium valproate and valproic acid increase the secobarbital sodium serum levels; therefore, secobarbital sodium blood levels should be monitored closely and appropriate dosage adjustments made as clinically indicated.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Estradiol, Estrone, Progesterone, and Other Steroidal Hormones Pretreatment with or concurrent administration of phenobarbital may decrease the effect of estradiol by increasing its metabolism.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hepatic enzyme-inducing drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone, rifampin) can increase valproate clearance, while enzyme inhibitors (e.g., felbamate) can decrease valproate clearance.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For example, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital (or primidone) can double the clearance of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thus, patients on monotherapy will generally have longer half-lives and higher concentrations than patients receiving polytherapy with antiepilepsy drugs.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Increasing the felbamate dose to 2,400 mg/day increased the mean valproate peak concentration to 133 mcg/mL (another 16% increase).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A decrease in valproate dosage may be necessary when felbamate therapy is initiated.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rifampin A study involving the administration of a single dose of valproate (7 mg/kg) 36 hours after 5 nights of daily dosing with rifampin (600 mg) revealed a 40% increase in the oral clearance of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rare postmarketing reports of concurrent use of valproate and amitriptyline resulting in an increased amitriptyline level have been received.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Consideration should be given to lowering the dose of amitriptyline/nortriptyline in the presence of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Rufinamide Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, rufinamide clearance was decreased by valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rufinamide concentrations were increased by <16% to 70%, dependent on concentration of valproate (with the larger increases being seen in pediatric patients at high doses or concentrations of valproate).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients stabilized on rufinamide before being prescribed valproate should begin valproate therapy at a low dose, and titrate to a clinically effective dose.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Similarly, patients on valproate should begin at a rufinamide dose lower than 10 mg/kg per day (pediatric patients) or 400 mg per day (adults).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Tolbutamide From in vitro experiments, the unbound fraction of tolbutamide was increased from 20% to 50% when added to plasma samples taken from patients treated with valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Co-administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and olanzapine (5 mg) to healthy adults (n=10) caused 15% reduction in Cmax and 35% reduction in AUC of olanzapine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Protein binding of valproate is reduced in the elderly, in patients with chronic hepatic diseases, in patients with renal impairment, and in the presence of other drugs (e.g., aspirin).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Conversely, valproate may displace certain protein-bound drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, warfarin, and tolbutamide).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For example, patients taking enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital) will clear valproate more rapidly.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	In the fed state, praziquantel (40 mg/kg) increased mean maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve of albendazole sulfoxide by about 50% in healthy subjects (n = 10) compared with a separate group of subjects (n = 6) given albendazole alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Albendazole sulfoxide concentrations in bile and cystic fluid were increased (about 2-fold) in hydatid cyst patients treated with cimetidine (10 mg/kg/day) (n = 7) compared with albendazole (20 mg/kg/day) alone (n = 12).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Oral bioavailability appears to be enhanced when albendazole is coadministered with a fatty meal (estimated fat content 40 grams) as evidenced by higher (up to 5-fold on average) plasma concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide as compared to the fasted state.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, CONTRAVE should not be taken with a high-fat meal because of a resulting significant increase in bupropion and naltrexone systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During concomitant use with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel), the maximum recommended daily dose of CONTRAVE is two tablets (one tablet each morning and evening).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6: Bupropion inhibits CYP2D6 and can increase concentrations of: antidepressants, (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and many tricyclics), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide): Consider dose reduction when using with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant Treatment with CYP2B6 Inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel) can increase bupropion exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Do not exceed one tablet twice daily when taken with CYP2B6 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Studies in animals demonstrate that the acute toxicity of bupropion is enhanced by the MAOI phenelzine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CONTRAVE increased metoprolol AUC and Cmax by approximately 4- and 2-fold, respectively, relative to metoprolol alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Similar clinical drug interactions resulting in increased pharmacokinetic exposure of CYP2D6 substrates have also been observed with bupropion as a single agent with desipramine or venlafaxine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Coadministration of CONTRAVE with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isozyme including certain antidepressants (SSRIs and many tricyclics), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If CONTRAVE is added to the treatment regimen of a patient already receiving a drug metabolized by CYP2D6, the need to decrease the dose of the original medication should be considered, particularly for those concomitant medications with a narrow therapeutic index.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Inhibitors of CYP2B6: Ticlopidine and Clopidogrel: Concomitant treatment with these drugs can increase bupropion exposure but decrease hydroxybupropion exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During concomitant use with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel), the CONTRAVE daily dose should not exceed two tablets (one tablet each morning and evening).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The systemic concentrations of substrate drugs transported by OCT2 (such as amantadine, amiloride, cimetidine, dopamine, famotidine, memantine, metformin, pindolol, procainamide, ranitidine, varenicline, oxaliplatin) are likely to increase as a result of reduced renal clearance when coadministered with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food Effect on Absorption When CONTRAVE was administered with a high-fat meal, the AUC and Cmax for naltrexone increased 2.1-fold and 3.7-fold, respectively, and the AUC and Cmax for bupropion increased 1.4-fold and 1.8-fold, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	At steady state, the food effect increased AUC and Cmax for naltrexone by 1.7-fold and 1.9-fold, respectively, and increased AUC and Cmax for bupropion by 1.1-fold and 1.3-fold, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thus, CONTRAVE should not be taken with high-fat meals because of the resulting significant increases in bupropion and naltrexone systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In vitro studies suggest that paroxetine, sertraline, norfluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and nelfinavir inhibit the hydroxylation of bupropion.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The systemic concentrations of substrate drugs transported by OCT2 are likely to increase as a result of reduced renal clearance when coadministered with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	While not systematically studied, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or phenytoin may induce the metabolism of bupropion.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Chlorpheniramine may inhibit the hepatic metabolism of phenytoin, monitor phenytoin toxicity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effect on Food In food-effect studies in healthy subjects receiving DEXILANT under various fed conditions compared to fasting, increases in Cmax ranged from 12 to 55%, increases in AUC ranged from 9 to 37%, and Tmax varied (ranging from a decrease of 0.7 hours to an increase of three hours).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The mean AUC of the active metabolite of clopidogrel was reduced by approximately 9% (mean AUC ratio was 91%, with 90% CI of 86 to 97%) when DEXILANT was co-administered compared to administration of clopidogrel alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lithium generally should not be given with diuretics because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A number of drugs, including ethacrynic acid, have been shown to displace warfarin from plasma protein; a reduction in the usual anticoagulant dosage may be required in patients receiving both drugs.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lithium: Metronidazole has been reported to elevate serum lithium levels.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Phenytoin, Fosphenytoin: Concomitant administration of oral metronidazole and intravenous phenytoin was reported to result in prolongation of the half-life and reduction in the clearance of phenytoin.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	CYP3A4 Inducers and Inhibitors: Simultaneous administration of tinidazole with drugs that induce liver microsomal enzymes, i.e., CYP3A4 inducers such as phenobarbital, rifampin, phenytoin, and fosphenytoin (a pro-drug of phenytoin), may accelerate the elimination of tinidazole, decreasing the plasma level of tinidazole.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Simultaneous administration of drugs that inhibit the activity of liver microsomal enzymes, i.e., CYP3A4 inhibitors such as cimetidine and ketoconazole, may prolong the half-life and decrease the plasma clearance of tinidazole, increasing the plasma concentrations of tinidazole.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cholestyramine: Cholestyramine was shown to decrease the oral bioavailability of metronidazole by 21%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Administration of Tindamax tablets with food resulted in a delay in T max of approximately 2 hours and a decline in Cmax of approximately 10%, compared to fasted conditions.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In clinical studies, the majority of patients required a decrease in daily levodopa dose if their daily dose of levodopa had been greater than or equal to 800 mg or if patients had moderate or severe dyskinesia before beginning treatment.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	To optimize an individual patient's response, reductions in daily levodopa dose or extending the interval between doses may be necessary.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In clinical studies, the average reduction in daily levodopa dose was about 25% in those patients requiring a levodopa dose reduction (more than 58% of patients with levodopa doses above 800 mg daily required such a reduction).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When entacapone is given in conjunction with levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, such as carbidopa, plasma levels of levodopa are greater and more sustained than after administration of levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is believed that at a given frequency of levodopa administration, these more sustained plasma levels of levodopa result in more constant dopaminergic stimulation in the brain, leading to greater effects on the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When 200 mg entacapone is administered together with levodopa and carbidopa, it increases the area under the curve (AUC) of levodopa by approximately 35%, and the elimination half-life of levodopa is prolonged from 1.3 hours to 2.4 hours.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When colesevelam is coadministered with glipizide ER, maximum plasma concentration and total exposure to glipizide is reduced.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The mean percentage increase in the GLUCOTROL AUC after fluconazole administration was 56.9% (range: 35 to 81).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In studies assessing the effect of colesevelam on the pharmacokinetics of glipizide ER in healthy volunteers, reductions in glipizide AUC0<U+2013><U+221E> and Cmax of 12% and 13%, respectively were observed when colesevelam was coadministered with glipizide ER.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, GLUCOTROL should be administered at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam to ensure that colesevelam does not reduce the absorption of glipizide.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Total absorption and disposition of an oral dose was unaffected by food in normal volunteers, but absorption was delayed by about 40 minutes.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concurrent administration of lorazepam with valproate results in increased plasma concentrations and reduced clearance of lorazepam.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lorazepam dosage should be reduced to approximately 50% when co-administered with valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concurrent administration of lorazepam with probenecid may result in a more rapid onset or prolonged effect of lorazepam due to increased half-life and decreased total clearance.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lorazepam dosage needs to be reduced by approximately 50% when co-administered with probenecid.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effects of probenecid and valproate on lorazepam may be due to inhibition of glucuronidation.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Continue until methotrexate level is below 5 x 10-8 M (0.05 micromolar).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Continue Levoleucovorin for injection administration, hydration, and urinary alkalinization (pH 7.0 or greater) until the methotrexate level is below 5 x 10-8 M (0.05 micromolar).	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Continue 7.5 mg by intravenous infusion every 6 hours, until methotrexate level is less than 0.05 micromolar.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Delayed early methotrexate elimination and/or evidence of acute renal injury* Serum methotrexate level of 50 micromolar or more at 24 hours, or 5 micromolar or more at 48 hours after administration, OR 100% or greater increase in serum creatinine level at 24 hours after methotrexate administration (e.g., an increase from 0.5 mg/dL to a level of 1 mg/dL or more).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In addition to appropriate levoleucovorin for injection therapy, continue hydration and urinary alkalinization, and monitoring of fluid and electrolyte status, until the serum methotrexate level has fallen to below 0.05 micromolar and the renal failure has resolved.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effect of leu co vorin products on fluorouracil : Leucovorin products increase the toxicity of fluorouracil.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Leucovorin products increase the toxicities of fluorouracil.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Coadministration of ACTOS and gemfibrozil, a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, increases pioglitazone exposure approximately 3-fold.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of ACTOS is 15 mg daily when used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Strong CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g., gemfibrozil) increase pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CYP2C8 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may decrease pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Topiramate may decrease pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An inhibitor of CYP2C8 (e.g., gemfibrozil) significantly increases the exposure (area under the serum concentration-time curve or AUC) and half-life (t1/2) of pioglitazone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of ACTOS is 15 mg daily if used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An inducer of CYP2C8 (e.g., rifampin) may significantly decrease the exposure (AUC) of pioglitazone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A decrease in the exposure of pioglitazone and its active metabolites were noted with concomitant administration of pioglitazone and topiramate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food delays the Tmax to three to four hours but does not alter the extent of absorption (AUC).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In an in vitro study in human liver microsomes, inhibition of CYP2A6 hydroxylation of coumarin by fondaparinux (200 micromolar i.e., 350 mg/L) was 17 to 28%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effects of NUVIGIL on CYP3A4/5 Substrates The clearance of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A4/5 (e.g., steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, and triazolam) may be increased by NUVIGIL via induction of metabolic enzymes, which results in lower systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Blood levels of cyclosporine may be reduced when used with NUVIGIL.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effects of NUVIGIL on CYP2C19 Substrates Elimination of drugs that are substrates for CYP2C19 (e.g., phenytoin, diazepam, propranolol, omeprazole, and clomipramine) may be prolonged by NUVIGIL via inhibition of metabolic enzymes, with resultant higher systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cyclosporine: blood concentrations of cyclosporine may be reduced.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CYP2C19 substrates, such as omeprazole, phenytoin, and diazepam: exposure of these medications may be increased.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food effect on the overall bioavailability of NUVIGIL is considered minimal; however, time to reach peak concentration (tmax) may be delayed by approximately 2-4 hours in the fed state.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 250 mg resulted in a reduction in systemic exposure to midazolam by 32% after a single oral dose (5 mg) and 17% after a single intravenous dose (2 mg).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the blood levels and effectiveness of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A enzymes (e.g., steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, and triazolam) may be reduced after initiation of concomitant treatment with NUVIGIL.In a separate clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 250 mg with quetiapine (300 mg to 600 mg daily doses) resulted in a reduction in the mean systemic exposure of quetiapine by approximately 29%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 400 mg resulted in a 40% increase in exposure to omeprazole after a single oral dose (40 mg), as a result of moderate inhibition of CYP2C19 activity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Interactions with CNS Active Drugs Concomitant administration of NUVIGIL with quetiapine reduced the systemic exposure of quetiapine.Data specific to NUVIGIL drug-drug interaction potential with other CNS active drugs are not available.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant administration of modafinil with methylphenidate or dextroamphetamine produced no significant alterations on the pharmacokinetic profile of modafinil or either stimulant, even though the absorption of modafinil was delayed for approximately one hour.Concomitant modafinil or clomipramine did not alter the pharmacokinetic profile of either drug; however, one incident of increased levels of clomipramine and its active metabolite desmethylclomipramine was reported in a patient with narcolepsy during treatment with modafinil.Data specific to NUVIGIL or modafinil drug-drug interaction potential with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors are not available.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Barbiturates can induce hepatic microsomal enzymes, resulting in increased metabolism and decreased anticoagulant response of oral anticoagulants (eg, warfarin, acenocoumarol, dicumarol, and phenprocoumon).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Corticosteroids Barbiturates appear to enhance the metabolism of exogenous corticosteroids, probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Griseofulvin Phenobarbital appears to interfere with the absorption of orally administered griseofulvin, thus decreasing its blood level.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effect of the resultant decreased blood levels of griseofulvin on therapeutic response has not been established.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Doxycycline Phenobarbital has been shown to shorten the half-life of doxycycline for as long as 2 weeks after barbiturate therapy is discontinued.This mechanism is probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes that metabolize the antibiotic.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Sodium valproate and valproic acid increase the secobarbital sodium serum levels; therefore, secobarbital sodium blood levels should be monitored closely and appropriate dosage adjustments made as clinically indicated.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Estradiol, Estrone, Progesterone, and Other Steroidal Hormones Pretreatment with or concurrent administration of phenobarbital may decrease the effect of estradiol by increasing its metabolism.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hepatic enzyme-inducing drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone, rifampin) can increase valproate clearance, while enzyme inhibitors (e.g., felbamate) can decrease valproate clearance.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For example, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital (or primidone) can double the clearance of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thus, patients on monotherapy will generally have longer half-lives and higher concentrations than patients receiving polytherapy with antiepilepsy drugs.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drugs for which a potentially important interaction has been observed Aspirin A study involving the co-administration of aspirin at antipyretic doses (11 to 16 mg/kg) with valproate to pediatric patients (n = 6) revealed a decrease in protein binding and an inhibition of metabolism of valproate.

5	Increasing the felbamate dose to 2,400 mg/day increased the mean valproate peak concentration to 133 mcg/mL (another 16% increase).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A decrease in valproate dosage may be necessary when felbamate therapy is initiated.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rifampin A study involving the administration of a single dose of valproate (7 mg/kg) 36 hours after 5 nights of daily dosing with rifampin (600 mg) revealed a 40% increase in the oral clearance of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rare postmarketing reports of concurrent use of valproate and amitriptyline resulting in an increased amitriptyline level have been received.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Consideration should be given to lowering the dose of amitriptyline/nortriptyline in the presence of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Carbamazepine/carbamazepine-10,11-Epoxide Serum levels of carbamazepine (CBZ) decreased 17% while that of carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide (CBZ-E) increased by 45% upon co-administration of valproate and CBZ to epileptic patients.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Administration of a single ethosuximide dose of 500 mg with valproate (800 to 1,600 mg/day) to healthy volunteers (n = 6) was accompanied by a 25% increase in elimination half-life of ethosuximide and a 15% decrease in its total clearance as compared to ethosuximide alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lamotrigine In a steady-state study involving 10 healthy volunteers, the elimination half-life of lamotrigine increased from 26 to 70 hours with valproate co-administration (a 165% increase).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The dose of lamotrigine should be reduced when co-administered with valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Phenobarbital Valproate was found to inhibit the metabolism of phenobarbital.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Co-administration of valproate (250 mg BID for 14 days) with phenobarbital to normal subjects (n = 6) resulted in a 50% increase in half-life and a 30% decrease in plasma clearance of phenobarbital (60 mg single-dose).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The fraction of phenobarbital dose excreted unchanged increased by 50% in presence of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Serum barbiturate concentrations should be obtained, if possible, and the barbiturate dosage decreased, if appropriate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Phenytoin Valproate displaces phenytoin from its plasma albumin binding sites and inhibits its hepatic metabolism.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Co-administration of valproate (400 mg TID) with phenytoin (250 mg) in normal volunteers (n = 7) was associated with a 60% increase in the free fraction of phenytoin.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Both the clearance and apparent volume of distribution of free phenytoin were reduced by 25%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Propofol The concomitant use of valproate and propofol may lead to increased blood levels of propofol.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Reduce the dose of propofol when co-administering with valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rufinamide Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, rufinamide clearance was decreased by valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rufinamide concentrations were increased by <16% to 70%, dependent on concentration of valproate (with the larger increases being seen in pediatric patients at high doses or concentrations of valproate).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients stabilized on rufinamide before being prescribed valproate should begin valproate therapy at a low dose, and titrate to a clinically effective dose.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Similarly, patients on valproate should begin at a rufinamide dose lower than 10 mg/kg per day (pediatric patients) or 400 mg per day (adults).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Tolbutamide From in vitro experiments, the unbound fraction of tolbutamide was increased from 20% to 50% when added to plasma samples taken from patients treated with valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Zidovudine In six patients who were seropositive for HIV, the clearance of zidovudine (100 mg q8h) was decreased by 38% after administration of valproate (250 or 500 mg q8h); the half-life of zidovudine was unaffected.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lorazepam Concomitant administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and lorazepam (1 mg BID) in normal male volunteers (n = 9) was accompanied by a 17% decrease in the plasma clearance of lorazepam.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Co-administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and olanzapine (5 mg) to healthy adults (n=10) caused 15% reduction in Cmax and 35% reduction in AUC of olanzapine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Protein binding of valproate is reduced in the elderly, in patients with chronic hepatic diseases, in patients with renal impairment, and in the presence of other drugs (e.g., aspirin).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Conversely, valproate may displace certain protein-bound drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, warfarin, and tolbutamide).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For example, patients taking enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital) will clear valproate more rapidly.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dexamethasone: Steady-state trough concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide were about 56% higher when dexamethasone was coadministered with each dose of albendazole.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Praziquantel: In the fed state increased mean maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve of albendazole sulfoxide by about 50% in healthy subjects.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cimetidine: Increased albendazole sulfoxide concentrations in bile and cystic fluid by about 2-fold in hydatid cyst patients.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Steady-state trough concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide were about 56% higher when 8 mg dexamethasone was co-administered with each dose of albendazole (15 mg/kg/day) in 8 neurocysticercosis patients.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In the fed state, praziquantel (40 mg/kg) increased mean maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve of albendazole sulfoxide by about 50% in healthy subjects (n = 10) compared with a separate group of subjects (n = 6) given albendazole alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Albendazole sulfoxide concentrations in bile and cystic fluid were increased (about 2-fold) in hydatid cyst patients treated with cimetidine (10 mg/kg/day) (n = 7) compared with albendazole (20 mg/kg/day) alone (n = 12).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Oral bioavailability appears to be enhanced when albendazole is coadministered with a fatty meal (estimated fat content 40 grams) as evidenced by higher (up to 5-fold on average) plasma concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide as compared to the fasted state.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, CONTRAVE should not be taken with a high-fat meal because of a resulting significant increase in bupropion and naltrexone systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During concomitant use with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel), the maximum recommended daily dose of CONTRAVE is two tablets (one tablet each morning and evening).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6: Bupropion inhibits CYP2D6 and can increase concentrations of: antidepressants, (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and many tricyclics), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide): Consider dose reduction when using with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant Treatment with CYP2B6 Inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel) can increase bupropion exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Do not exceed one tablet twice daily when taken with CYP2B6 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Studies in animals demonstrate that the acute toxicity of bupropion is enhanced by the MAOI phenelzine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CONTRAVE increased metoprolol AUC and Cmax by approximately 4- and 2-fold, respectively, relative to metoprolol alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Similar clinical drug interactions resulting in increased pharmacokinetic exposure of CYP2D6 substrates have also been observed with bupropion as a single agent with desipramine or venlafaxine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Coadministration of CONTRAVE with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isozyme including certain antidepressants (SSRIs and many tricyclics), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If CONTRAVE is added to the treatment regimen of a patient already receiving a drug metabolized by CYP2D6, the need to decrease the dose of the original medication should be considered, particularly for those concomitant medications with a narrow therapeutic index.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Inhibitors of CYP2B6: Ticlopidine and Clopidogrel: Concomitant treatment with these drugs can increase bupropion exposure but decrease hydroxybupropion exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During concomitant use with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel), the CONTRAVE daily dose should not exceed two tablets (one tablet each morning and evening).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The systemic concentrations of substrate drugs transported by OCT2 (such as amantadine, amiloride, cimetidine, dopamine, famotidine, memantine, metformin, pindolol, procainamide, ranitidine, varenicline, oxaliplatin) are likely to increase as a result of reduced renal clearance when coadministered with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food Effect on Absorption When CONTRAVE was administered with a high-fat meal, the AUC and Cmax for naltrexone increased 2.1-fold and 3.7-fold, respectively, and the AUC and Cmax for bupropion increased 1.4-fold and 1.8-fold, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	At steady state, the food effect increased AUC and Cmax for naltrexone by 1.7-fold and 1.9-fold, respectively, and increased AUC and Cmax for bupropion by 1.1-fold and 1.3-fold, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thus, CONTRAVE should not be taken with high-fat meals because of the resulting significant increases in bupropion and naltrexone systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In vitro studies suggest that paroxetine, sertraline, norfluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and nelfinavir inhibit the hydroxylation of bupropion.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The systemic concentrations of substrate drugs transported by OCT2 are likely to increase as a result of reduced renal clearance when coadministered with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	While not systematically studied, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or phenytoin may induce the metabolism of bupropion.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Chlorpheniramine may inhibit the hepatic metabolism of phenytoin, monitor phenytoin toxicity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The concurrent use of drugs that preferentially induce codeine N-demethylation (via CYP3A4) may increase the plasma concentrations of codeine<U+2019>s inactive metabolite norcodeine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drugs that inhibit codeine O-demethylation (via CYP2D6), may decrease the plasma concentration of codeine<U+2019>s active metabolites, morphine and morphine-6-glucuronide.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Adverse event reports in the literature suggest a possible drug interaction involving increased serum phenytoin levels and phenytoin toxicity when chlorpheniramine and phenytoin are co-administered.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The exact mechanism for this interaction is not known, however it is believed that chlorpheniramine may inhibit the hepatic metabolism of phenytoin.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There was a slight increase in the area under the curve (AUC, 11%) and mean peak drug concentration (Cmax, 18%) of digoxin with the coadministration of 100 mg sitagliptin for 10 days.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cimetidine: Acyclovir Cmax and AUC following a single dose of VALTREX (1 gram) increased by 8% and 32%, respectively, after a single dose of cimetidine (800 mg).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cimetidine Plus Probenecid: Acyclovir Cmax and AUC following a single dose of VALTREX (1 gram) increased by 30% and 78%, respectively, after a combination of cimetidine and probenecid, primarily due to a reduction in renal clearance of acyclovir.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Probenecid: Acyclovir Cmax and AUC following a single dose of VALTREX (1 gram) increased by 22% and 49%, respectively, after probenecid (1 gram).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Administration with rifampin or rifabutin is known to reduce atovaquone concentrations; concomitant use with MALARONE is not recommended.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant administration of rifampin or rifabutin is known to reduce atovaquone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant treatment with tetracycline has been associated with a reduction in plasma concentrations of atovaquone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	While antiemetics may be indicated for patients receiving MALARONE, metoclopramide may reduce the bioavailability of atovaquone and should be used only if other antiemetics are not available.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant administration of atovaquone and indinavir did not result in any change in the steady<U+2011>state AUC and Cmax of indinavir but resulted in a decrease in the Ctrough of indinavir.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Caution should be exercised when prescribing atovaquone with indinavir due to the decrease in trough concentrations of indinavir.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dietary fat taken with atovaquone increases the rate and extent of absorption, increasing AUC 2 to 3 times and Cmax 5 times over fasting.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rifampin/Rifabutin: Concomitant administration of rifampin or rifabutin is known to reduce atovaquone concentrations by approximately 50% and 34%, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Metoclopramide: Concomitant treatment with metoclopramide has been associated with decreased bioavailability of atovaquone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Indinavir: Concomitant administration of atovaquone (750 mg twice daily with food for 14 days) and indinavir (800 mg three times daily without food for 14 days) did not result in any change in the steady<U+2011>state AUC and Cmax of indinavir but resulted in a decrease in the Ctrough of indinavir (23% decrease [90% CI = 8%, 35%]).

5	Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed in patients treated with DEXILANT.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Simultaneous administration of drugs that inhibit the activity of liver microsomal enzymes, i.e., CYP3A4 inhibitors such as cimetidine and ketoconazole, may prolong the half-life and decrease the plasma clearance of tinidazole, increasing the plasma concentrations of tinidazole.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Administration of Tindamax tablets with food resulted in a delay in T max of approximately 2 hours and a decline in Cmax of approximately 10%, compared to fasted conditions.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In clinical studies, the majority of patients required a decrease in daily levodopa dose if their daily dose of levodopa had been greater than or equal to 800 mg or if patients had moderate or severe dyskinesia before beginning treatment.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	To optimize an individual patient's response, reductions in daily levodopa dose or extending the interval between doses may be necessary.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In clinical studies, the average reduction in daily levodopa dose was about 25% in those patients requiring a levodopa dose reduction (more than 58% of patients with levodopa doses above 800 mg daily required such a reduction).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When entacapone is given in conjunction with levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, such as carbidopa, plasma levels of levodopa are greater and more sustained than after administration of levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is believed that at a given frequency of levodopa administration, these more sustained plasma levels of levodopa result in more constant dopaminergic stimulation in the brain, leading to greater effects on the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When 200 mg entacapone is administered together with levodopa and carbidopa, it increases the area under the curve (AUC) of levodopa by approximately 35%, and the elimination half-life of levodopa is prolonged from 1.3 hours to 2.4 hours.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When colesevelam is coadministered with glipizide ER, maximum plasma concentration and total exposure to glipizide is reduced.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The mean percentage increase in the GLUCOTROL AUC after fluconazole administration was 56.9% (range: 35 to 81).	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Lorazepam dosage needs to be reduced by approximately 50% when co-administered with probenecid.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effects of probenecid and valproate on lorazepam may be due to inhibition of glucuronidation.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In addition to appropriate levoleucovorin for injection therapy, continue hydration and urinary alkalinization, and monitoring of fluid and electrolyte status, until the serum methotrexate level has fallen to below 0.05 micromolar and the renal failure has resolved.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effect of leu co vorin products on fluorouracil : Leucovorin products increase the toxicity of fluorouracil.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Coadministration of ACTOS and gemfibrozil, a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, increases pioglitazone exposure approximately 3-fold.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of ACTOS is 15 mg daily when used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Strong CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g., gemfibrozil) increase pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CYP2C8 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may decrease pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Topiramate may decrease pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An inhibitor of CYP2C8 (e.g., gemfibrozil) significantly increases the exposure (area under the serum concentration-time curve or AUC) and half-life (t1/2) of pioglitazone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of ACTOS is 15 mg daily if used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An inducer of CYP2C8 (e.g., rifampin) may significantly decrease the exposure (AUC) of pioglitazone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A decrease in the exposure of pioglitazone and its active metabolites were noted with concomitant administration of pioglitazone and topiramate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food delays the Tmax to three to four hours but does not alter the extent of absorption (AUC).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In an in vitro study in human liver microsomes, inhibition of CYP2A6 hydroxylation of coumarin by fondaparinux (200 micromolar i.e., 350 mg/L) was 17 to 28%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effects of NUVIGIL on CYP3A4/5 Substrates The clearance of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A4/5 (e.g., steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, and triazolam) may be increased by NUVIGIL via induction of metabolic enzymes, which results in lower systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Blood levels of cyclosporine may be reduced when used with NUVIGIL.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effects of NUVIGIL on CYP2C19 Substrates Elimination of drugs that are substrates for CYP2C19 (e.g., phenytoin, diazepam, propranolol, omeprazole, and clomipramine) may be prolonged by NUVIGIL via inhibition of metabolic enzymes, with resultant higher systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cyclosporine: blood concentrations of cyclosporine may be reduced.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CYP2C19 substrates, such as omeprazole, phenytoin, and diazepam: exposure of these medications may be increased.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food effect on the overall bioavailability of NUVIGIL is considered minimal; however, time to reach peak concentration (tmax) may be delayed by approximately 2-4 hours in the fed state.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 250 mg resulted in a reduction in systemic exposure to midazolam by 32% after a single oral dose (5 mg) and 17% after a single intravenous dose (2 mg).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the blood levels and effectiveness of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A enzymes (e.g., steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, and triazolam) may be reduced after initiation of concomitant treatment with NUVIGIL.In a separate clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 250 mg with quetiapine (300 mg to 600 mg daily doses) resulted in a reduction in the mean systemic exposure of quetiapine by approximately 29%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 400 mg resulted in a 40% increase in exposure to omeprazole after a single oral dose (40 mg), as a result of moderate inhibition of CYP2C19 activity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Interactions with CNS Active Drugs Concomitant administration of NUVIGIL with quetiapine reduced the systemic exposure of quetiapine.Data specific to NUVIGIL drug-drug interaction potential with other CNS active drugs are not available.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant administration of modafinil with methylphenidate or dextroamphetamine produced no significant alterations on the pharmacokinetic profile of modafinil or either stimulant, even though the absorption of modafinil was delayed for approximately one hour.Concomitant modafinil or clomipramine did not alter the pharmacokinetic profile of either drug; however, one incident of increased levels of clomipramine and its active metabolite desmethylclomipramine was reported in a patient with narcolepsy during treatment with modafinil.Data specific to NUVIGIL or modafinil drug-drug interaction potential with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors are not available.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Barbiturates can induce hepatic microsomal enzymes, resulting in increased metabolism and decreased anticoagulant response of oral anticoagulants (eg, warfarin, acenocoumarol, dicumarol, and phenprocoumon).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Corticosteroids Barbiturates appear to enhance the metabolism of exogenous corticosteroids, probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	The effect of the resultant decreased blood levels of griseofulvin on therapeutic response has not been established.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Doxycycline Phenobarbital has been shown to shorten the half-life of doxycycline for as long as 2 weeks after barbiturate therapy is discontinued.This mechanism is probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes that metabolize the antibiotic.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Sodium valproate and valproic acid increase the secobarbital sodium serum levels; therefore, secobarbital sodium blood levels should be monitored closely and appropriate dosage adjustments made as clinically indicated.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Estradiol, Estrone, Progesterone, and Other Steroidal Hormones Pretreatment with or concurrent administration of phenobarbital may decrease the effect of estradiol by increasing its metabolism.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hepatic enzyme-inducing drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone, rifampin) can increase valproate clearance, while enzyme inhibitors (e.g., felbamate) can decrease valproate clearance.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For example, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital (or primidone) can double the clearance of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thus, patients on monotherapy will generally have longer half-lives and higher concentrations than patients receiving polytherapy with antiepilepsy drugs.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Rufinamide Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, rufinamide clearance was decreased by valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rufinamide concentrations were increased by <16% to 70%, dependent on concentration of valproate (with the larger increases being seen in pediatric patients at high doses or concentrations of valproate).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients stabilized on rufinamide before being prescribed valproate should begin valproate therapy at a low dose, and titrate to a clinically effective dose.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Similarly, patients on valproate should begin at a rufinamide dose lower than 10 mg/kg per day (pediatric patients) or 400 mg per day (adults).	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Protein binding of valproate is reduced in the elderly, in patients with chronic hepatic diseases, in patients with renal impairment, and in the presence of other drugs (e.g., aspirin).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Conversely, valproate may displace certain protein-bound drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, warfarin, and tolbutamide).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For example, patients taking enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital) will clear valproate more rapidly.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	In the fed state, praziquantel (40 mg/kg) increased mean maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve of albendazole sulfoxide by about 50% in healthy subjects (n = 10) compared with a separate group of subjects (n = 6) given albendazole alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Albendazole sulfoxide concentrations in bile and cystic fluid were increased (about 2-fold) in hydatid cyst patients treated with cimetidine (10 mg/kg/day) (n = 7) compared with albendazole (20 mg/kg/day) alone (n = 12).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Oral bioavailability appears to be enhanced when albendazole is coadministered with a fatty meal (estimated fat content 40 grams) as evidenced by higher (up to 5-fold on average) plasma concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide as compared to the fasted state.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, CONTRAVE should not be taken with a high-fat meal because of a resulting significant increase in bupropion and naltrexone systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During concomitant use with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel), the maximum recommended daily dose of CONTRAVE is two tablets (one tablet each morning and evening).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6: Bupropion inhibits CYP2D6 and can increase concentrations of: antidepressants, (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and many tricyclics), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide): Consider dose reduction when using with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant Treatment with CYP2B6 Inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel) can increase bupropion exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Do not exceed one tablet twice daily when taken with CYP2B6 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Studies in animals demonstrate that the acute toxicity of bupropion is enhanced by the MAOI phenelzine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CONTRAVE increased metoprolol AUC and Cmax by approximately 4- and 2-fold, respectively, relative to metoprolol alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Similar clinical drug interactions resulting in increased pharmacokinetic exposure of CYP2D6 substrates have also been observed with bupropion as a single agent with desipramine or venlafaxine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Coadministration of CONTRAVE with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isozyme including certain antidepressants (SSRIs and many tricyclics), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If CONTRAVE is added to the treatment regimen of a patient already receiving a drug metabolized by CYP2D6, the need to decrease the dose of the original medication should be considered, particularly for those concomitant medications with a narrow therapeutic index.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Inhibitors of CYP2B6: Ticlopidine and Clopidogrel: Concomitant treatment with these drugs can increase bupropion exposure but decrease hydroxybupropion exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During concomitant use with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel), the CONTRAVE daily dose should not exceed two tablets (one tablet each morning and evening).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The systemic concentrations of substrate drugs transported by OCT2 (such as amantadine, amiloride, cimetidine, dopamine, famotidine, memantine, metformin, pindolol, procainamide, ranitidine, varenicline, oxaliplatin) are likely to increase as a result of reduced renal clearance when coadministered with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food Effect on Absorption When CONTRAVE was administered with a high-fat meal, the AUC and Cmax for naltrexone increased 2.1-fold and 3.7-fold, respectively, and the AUC and Cmax for bupropion increased 1.4-fold and 1.8-fold, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	At steady state, the food effect increased AUC and Cmax for naltrexone by 1.7-fold and 1.9-fold, respectively, and increased AUC and Cmax for bupropion by 1.1-fold and 1.3-fold, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thus, CONTRAVE should not be taken with high-fat meals because of the resulting significant increases in bupropion and naltrexone systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In vitro studies suggest that paroxetine, sertraline, norfluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and nelfinavir inhibit the hydroxylation of bupropion.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The systemic concentrations of substrate drugs transported by OCT2 are likely to increase as a result of reduced renal clearance when coadministered with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	While not systematically studied, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or phenytoin may induce the metabolism of bupropion.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Chlorpheniramine may inhibit the hepatic metabolism of phenytoin, monitor phenytoin toxicity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Drug Interaction Studies Products containing calcium and other multivalent cations (such as aluminum, magnesium, iron), including milk, food, and antacids are likely to interfere with absorption of ibandronate, which is consistent with findings in animal studies.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	H2 Blockers A pharmacokinetic interaction study in healthy volunteers demonstrated that 75 mg ranitidine (25 mg injected intravenously 90 and 15 minutes before and 30 minutes after ibandronate administration) increased the oral bioavailability of 10 mg ibandronate by about 20%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concurrent use of propantheline with slow-dissolving tablets of digoxin may cause increased serum digoxin levels.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Increase in plasma levels associated with coadministered drugs: Coadministration of atorvastatin and certain oral contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol increase AUC values for ethinyl estradiol by approximately 20%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Decreased plasma concentrations of acetaminophen and increased clearance of temazepam, salicylic acid, morphine, and clofibric acid, due to induction of conjugation, have been noted when these drugs were administered with oral contraceptives.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Free T3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG; free T4 concentration is unaltered.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Increased exposure of other antiretroviral drugs (e.g., saquinavir) when used concomitantly with dexlansoprazole may increase toxicity of the antiretroviral drugs.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Methotrexate Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose) may elevate and prolong serum concentrations of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Digoxin Clinical Impact: Potential for increased exposure of digoxin.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drugs Dependent on Gastric pH for Absorption (e.g., iron salts, erlotinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, mycophenolate mofetil, ketoconazole/itraconazole) Clinical Impact: Dexlansoprazole can reduce the absorption of other drugs due to its effect on reducing intragastric acidity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Intervention: Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF): Co-administration of PPIs in healthy subjects and in transplant patients receiving MMF has been reported to reduce the exposure to the active metabolite, mycophenolic acid (MPA), possibly due to a decrease in MMF solubility at an increased gastric pH.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The clinical relevance of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving DEXILANT and MMF.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Tacrolimus Clinical Impact: Potentially increased exposure of tacrolimus, especially in transplant patients who are intermediate or poor metabolizers of CYP2C19.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12) Deficiency: Daily long-term use (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption or a deficiency of cyanocobalamin.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Interaction with Methotrexate: Concomitant use with PPIs may elevate and/or prolong serum concentrations of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to toxicity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than three years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed in patients treated with DEXILANT.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effect on Food In food-effect studies in healthy subjects receiving DEXILANT under various fed conditions compared to fasting, increases in Cmax ranged from 12 to 55%, increases in AUC ranged from 9 to 37%, and Tmax varied (ranging from a decrease of 0.7 hours to an increase of three hours).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The mean AUC of the active metabolite of clopidogrel was reduced by approximately 9% (mean AUC ratio was 91%, with 90% CI of 86 to 97%) when DEXILANT was co-administered compared to administration of clopidogrel alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lithium generally should not be given with diuretics because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A number of drugs, including ethacrynic acid, have been shown to displace warfarin from plasma protein; a reduction in the usual anticoagulant dosage may be required in patients receiving both drugs.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lithium: Metronidazole has been reported to elevate serum lithium levels.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Phenytoin, Fosphenytoin: Concomitant administration of oral metronidazole and intravenous phenytoin was reported to result in prolongation of the half-life and reduction in the clearance of phenytoin.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cyclosporine, Tacrolimus: There are several case reports suggesting that metronidazole has the potential to increase the levels of cyclosporine and tacrolimus.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CYP3A4 Inducers and Inhibitors: Simultaneous administration of tinidazole with drugs that induce liver microsomal enzymes, i.e., CYP3A4 inducers such as phenobarbital, rifampin, phenytoin, and fosphenytoin (a pro-drug of phenytoin), may accelerate the elimination of tinidazole, decreasing the plasma level of tinidazole.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Simultaneous administration of drugs that inhibit the activity of liver microsomal enzymes, i.e., CYP3A4 inhibitors such as cimetidine and ketoconazole, may prolong the half-life and decrease the plasma clearance of tinidazole, increasing the plasma concentrations of tinidazole.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cholestyramine: Cholestyramine was shown to decrease the oral bioavailability of metronidazole by 21%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Administration of Tindamax tablets with food resulted in a delay in T max of approximately 2 hours and a decline in Cmax of approximately 10%, compared to fasted conditions.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In clinical studies, the majority of patients required a decrease in daily levodopa dose if their daily dose of levodopa had been greater than or equal to 800 mg or if patients had moderate or severe dyskinesia before beginning treatment.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	To optimize an individual patient's response, reductions in daily levodopa dose or extending the interval between doses may be necessary.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In clinical studies, the average reduction in daily levodopa dose was about 25% in those patients requiring a levodopa dose reduction (more than 58% of patients with levodopa doses above 800 mg daily required such a reduction).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When entacapone is given in conjunction with levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, such as carbidopa, plasma levels of levodopa are greater and more sustained than after administration of levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is believed that at a given frequency of levodopa administration, these more sustained plasma levels of levodopa result in more constant dopaminergic stimulation in the brain, leading to greater effects on the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When 200 mg entacapone is administered together with levodopa and carbidopa, it increases the area under the curve (AUC) of levodopa by approximately 35%, and the elimination half-life of levodopa is prolonged from 1.3 hours to 2.4 hours.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When colesevelam is coadministered with glipizide ER, maximum plasma concentration and total exposure to glipizide is reduced.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The mean percentage increase in the GLUCOTROL AUC after fluconazole administration was 56.9% (range: 35 to 81).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In studies assessing the effect of colesevelam on the pharmacokinetics of glipizide ER in healthy volunteers, reductions in glipizide AUC0<U+2013><U+221E> and Cmax of 12% and 13%, respectively were observed when colesevelam was coadministered with glipizide ER.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, GLUCOTROL should be administered at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam to ensure that colesevelam does not reduce the absorption of glipizide.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Total absorption and disposition of an oral dose was unaffected by food in normal volunteers, but absorption was delayed by about 40 minutes.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concurrent administration of lorazepam with valproate results in increased plasma concentrations and reduced clearance of lorazepam.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lorazepam dosage should be reduced to approximately 50% when co-administered with valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concurrent administration of lorazepam with probenecid may result in a more rapid onset or prolonged effect of lorazepam due to increased half-life and decreased total clearance.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lorazepam dosage needs to be reduced by approximately 50% when co-administered with probenecid.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effects of probenecid and valproate on lorazepam may be due to inhibition of glucuronidation.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Continue until methotrexate level is below 5 x 10-8 M (0.05 micromolar).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Continue Levoleucovorin for injection administration, hydration, and urinary alkalinization (pH 7.0 or greater) until the methotrexate level is below 5 x 10-8 M (0.05 micromolar).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Delayed late methotrexate elimination Serum methotrexate level remaining above 0.2 micromolar at 72 hours, and more than 0.05 micromolar at 96 hours after administration.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Continue 7.5 mg by intravenous infusion every 6 hours, until methotrexate level is less than 0.05 micromolar.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Delayed early methotrexate elimination and/or evidence of acute renal injury* Serum methotrexate level of 50 micromolar or more at 24 hours, or 5 micromolar or more at 48 hours after administration, OR 100% or greater increase in serum creatinine level at 24 hours after methotrexate administration (e.g., an increase from 0.5 mg/dL to a level of 1 mg/dL or more).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In addition to appropriate levoleucovorin for injection therapy, continue hydration and urinary alkalinization, and monitoring of fluid and electrolyte status, until the serum methotrexate level has fallen to below 0.05 micromolar and the renal failure has resolved.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effect of leu co vorin products on fluorouracil : Leucovorin products increase the toxicity of fluorouracil.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Leucovorin products increase the toxicities of fluorouracil.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Coadministration of ACTOS and gemfibrozil, a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, increases pioglitazone exposure approximately 3-fold.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of ACTOS is 15 mg daily when used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Strong CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g., gemfibrozil) increase pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CYP2C8 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may decrease pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Topiramate may decrease pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An inhibitor of CYP2C8 (e.g., gemfibrozil) significantly increases the exposure (area under the serum concentration-time curve or AUC) and half-life (t1/2) of pioglitazone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of ACTOS is 15 mg daily if used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An inducer of CYP2C8 (e.g., rifampin) may significantly decrease the exposure (AUC) of pioglitazone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A decrease in the exposure of pioglitazone and its active metabolites were noted with concomitant administration of pioglitazone and topiramate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food delays the Tmax to three to four hours but does not alter the extent of absorption (AUC).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In an in vitro study in human liver microsomes, inhibition of CYP2A6 hydroxylation of coumarin by fondaparinux (200 micromolar i.e., 350 mg/L) was 17 to 28%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effects of NUVIGIL on CYP3A4/5 Substrates The clearance of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A4/5 (e.g., steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, and triazolam) may be increased by NUVIGIL via induction of metabolic enzymes, which results in lower systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Blood levels of cyclosporine may be reduced when used with NUVIGIL.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effects of NUVIGIL on CYP2C19 Substrates Elimination of drugs that are substrates for CYP2C19 (e.g., phenytoin, diazepam, propranolol, omeprazole, and clomipramine) may be prolonged by NUVIGIL via inhibition of metabolic enzymes, with resultant higher systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cyclosporine: blood concentrations of cyclosporine may be reduced.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CYP2C19 substrates, such as omeprazole, phenytoin, and diazepam: exposure of these medications may be increased.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food effect on the overall bioavailability of NUVIGIL is considered minimal; however, time to reach peak concentration (tmax) may be delayed by approximately 2-4 hours in the fed state.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 250 mg resulted in a reduction in systemic exposure to midazolam by 32% after a single oral dose (5 mg) and 17% after a single intravenous dose (2 mg).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the blood levels and effectiveness of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A enzymes (e.g., steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, and triazolam) may be reduced after initiation of concomitant treatment with NUVIGIL.In a separate clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 250 mg with quetiapine (300 mg to 600 mg daily doses) resulted in a reduction in the mean systemic exposure of quetiapine by approximately 29%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 400 mg resulted in a 40% increase in exposure to omeprazole after a single oral dose (40 mg), as a result of moderate inhibition of CYP2C19 activity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Interactions with CNS Active Drugs Concomitant administration of NUVIGIL with quetiapine reduced the systemic exposure of quetiapine.Data specific to NUVIGIL drug-drug interaction potential with other CNS active drugs are not available.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant administration of modafinil with methylphenidate or dextroamphetamine produced no significant alterations on the pharmacokinetic profile of modafinil or either stimulant, even though the absorption of modafinil was delayed for approximately one hour.Concomitant modafinil or clomipramine did not alter the pharmacokinetic profile of either drug; however, one incident of increased levels of clomipramine and its active metabolite desmethylclomipramine was reported in a patient with narcolepsy during treatment with modafinil.Data specific to NUVIGIL or modafinil drug-drug interaction potential with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors are not available.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Barbiturates can induce hepatic microsomal enzymes, resulting in increased metabolism and decreased anticoagulant response of oral anticoagulants (eg, warfarin, acenocoumarol, dicumarol, and phenprocoumon).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Corticosteroids Barbiturates appear to enhance the metabolism of exogenous corticosteroids, probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Griseofulvin Phenobarbital appears to interfere with the absorption of orally administered griseofulvin, thus decreasing its blood level.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effect of the resultant decreased blood levels of griseofulvin on therapeutic response has not been established.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Doxycycline Phenobarbital has been shown to shorten the half-life of doxycycline for as long as 2 weeks after barbiturate therapy is discontinued.This mechanism is probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes that metabolize the antibiotic.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Sodium valproate and valproic acid increase the secobarbital sodium serum levels; therefore, secobarbital sodium blood levels should be monitored closely and appropriate dosage adjustments made as clinically indicated.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Estradiol, Estrone, Progesterone, and Other Steroidal Hormones Pretreatment with or concurrent administration of phenobarbital may decrease the effect of estradiol by increasing its metabolism.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hepatic enzyme-inducing drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone, rifampin) can increase valproate clearance, while enzyme inhibitors (e.g., felbamate) can decrease valproate clearance.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For example, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital (or primidone) can double the clearance of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thus, patients on monotherapy will generally have longer half-lives and higher concentrations than patients receiving polytherapy with antiepilepsy drugs.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drugs for which a potentially important interaction has been observed Aspirin A study involving the co-administration of aspirin at antipyretic doses (11 to 16 mg/kg) with valproate to pediatric patients (n = 6) revealed a decrease in protein binding and an inhibition of metabolism of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Valproate free fraction was increased 4-fold in the presence of aspirin compared to valproate alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The <U+03B2>-oxidation pathway consisting of 2-E-valproic acid, 3-OH-valproic acid, and 3-keto valproic acid was decreased from 25% of total metabolites excreted on valproate alone to 8.3% in the presence of aspirin.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Increasing the felbamate dose to 2,400 mg/day increased the mean valproate peak concentration to 133 mcg/mL (another 16% increase).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A decrease in valproate dosage may be necessary when felbamate therapy is initiated.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rifampin A study involving the administration of a single dose of valproate (7 mg/kg) 36 hours after 5 nights of daily dosing with rifampin (600 mg) revealed a 40% increase in the oral clearance of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Chlorpromazine A study involving the administration of 100 to 300 mg/day of chlorpromazine to schizophrenic patients already receiving valproate (200 mg BID) revealed a 15% increase in trough plasma levels of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drugs for which a potentially important valproate interaction has been observed Amitriptyline/Nortriptyline Administration of a single oral 50 mg dose of amitriptyline to 15 normal volunteers (10 males and 5 females) who received valproate (500 mg BID) resulted in a 21% decrease in plasma clearance of amitriptyline and a 34% decrease in the net clearance of nortriptyline.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rare postmarketing reports of concurrent use of valproate and amitriptyline resulting in an increased amitriptyline level have been received.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Consideration should be given to lowering the dose of amitriptyline/nortriptyline in the presence of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Carbamazepine/carbamazepine-10,11-Epoxide Serum levels of carbamazepine (CBZ) decreased 17% while that of carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide (CBZ-E) increased by 45% upon co-administration of valproate and CBZ to epileptic patients.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Diazepam Valproate displaces diazepam from its plasma albumin binding sites and inhibits its metabolism.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Co-administration of valproate (1,500 mg daily) increased the free fraction of diazepam (10 mg) by 90% in healthy volunteers (n = 6).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Plasma clearance and volume of distribution for free diazepam were reduced by 25% and 20%, respectively, in the presence of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Ethosuximide Valproate inhibits the metabolism of ethosuximide.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Administration of a single ethosuximide dose of 500 mg with valproate (800 to 1,600 mg/day) to healthy volunteers (n = 6) was accompanied by a 25% increase in elimination half-life of ethosuximide and a 15% decrease in its total clearance as compared to ethosuximide alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lamotrigine In a steady-state study involving 10 healthy volunteers, the elimination half-life of lamotrigine increased from 26 to 70 hours with valproate co-administration (a 165% increase).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The dose of lamotrigine should be reduced when co-administered with valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Phenobarbital Valproate was found to inhibit the metabolism of phenobarbital.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Co-administration of valproate (250 mg BID for 14 days) with phenobarbital to normal subjects (n = 6) resulted in a 50% increase in half-life and a 30% decrease in plasma clearance of phenobarbital (60 mg single-dose).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The fraction of phenobarbital dose excreted unchanged increased by 50% in presence of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Serum barbiturate concentrations should be obtained, if possible, and the barbiturate dosage decreased, if appropriate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Phenytoin Valproate displaces phenytoin from its plasma albumin binding sites and inhibits its hepatic metabolism.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Co-administration of valproate (400 mg TID) with phenytoin (250 mg) in normal volunteers (n = 7) was associated with a 60% increase in the free fraction of phenytoin.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Total plasma clearance and apparent volume of distribution of phenytoin increased 30% in the presence of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Both the clearance and apparent volume of distribution of free phenytoin were reduced by 25%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Propofol The concomitant use of valproate and propofol may lead to increased blood levels of propofol.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Reduce the dose of propofol when co-administering with valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rufinamide Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, rufinamide clearance was decreased by valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rufinamide concentrations were increased by <16% to 70%, dependent on concentration of valproate (with the larger increases being seen in pediatric patients at high doses or concentrations of valproate).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients stabilized on rufinamide before being prescribed valproate should begin valproate therapy at a low dose, and titrate to a clinically effective dose.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Similarly, patients on valproate should begin at a rufinamide dose lower than 10 mg/kg per day (pediatric patients) or 400 mg per day (adults).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Tolbutamide From in vitro experiments, the unbound fraction of tolbutamide was increased from 20% to 50% when added to plasma samples taken from patients treated with valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Warfarin In an in vitro study, valproate increased the unbound fraction of warfarin by up to 32.6%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Zidovudine In six patients who were seropositive for HIV, the clearance of zidovudine (100 mg q8h) was decreased by 38% after administration of valproate (250 or 500 mg q8h); the half-life of zidovudine was unaffected.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lorazepam Concomitant administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and lorazepam (1 mg BID) in normal male volunteers (n = 9) was accompanied by a 17% decrease in the plasma clearance of lorazepam.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Co-administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and olanzapine (5 mg) to healthy adults (n=10) caused 15% reduction in Cmax and 35% reduction in AUC of olanzapine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Protein binding of valproate is reduced in the elderly, in patients with chronic hepatic diseases, in patients with renal impairment, and in the presence of other drugs (e.g., aspirin).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Conversely, valproate may displace certain protein-bound drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, warfarin, and tolbutamide).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For example, patients taking enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital) will clear valproate more rapidly.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dexamethasone: Steady-state trough concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide were about 56% higher when dexamethasone was coadministered with each dose of albendazole.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Praziquantel: In the fed state increased mean maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve of albendazole sulfoxide by about 50% in healthy subjects.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cimetidine: Increased albendazole sulfoxide concentrations in bile and cystic fluid by about 2-fold in hydatid cyst patients.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Steady-state trough concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide were about 56% higher when 8 mg dexamethasone was co-administered with each dose of albendazole (15 mg/kg/day) in 8 neurocysticercosis patients.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In the fed state, praziquantel (40 mg/kg) increased mean maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve of albendazole sulfoxide by about 50% in healthy subjects (n = 10) compared with a separate group of subjects (n = 6) given albendazole alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Albendazole sulfoxide concentrations in bile and cystic fluid were increased (about 2-fold) in hydatid cyst patients treated with cimetidine (10 mg/kg/day) (n = 7) compared with albendazole (20 mg/kg/day) alone (n = 12).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Oral bioavailability appears to be enhanced when albendazole is coadministered with a fatty meal (estimated fat content 40 grams) as evidenced by higher (up to 5-fold on average) plasma concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide as compared to the fasted state.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, CONTRAVE should not be taken with a high-fat meal because of a resulting significant increase in bupropion and naltrexone systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During concomitant use with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel), the maximum recommended daily dose of CONTRAVE is two tablets (one tablet each morning and evening).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6: Bupropion inhibits CYP2D6 and can increase concentrations of: antidepressants, (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and many tricyclics), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide): Consider dose reduction when using with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant Treatment with CYP2B6 Inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel) can increase bupropion exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Do not exceed one tablet twice daily when taken with CYP2B6 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Studies in animals demonstrate that the acute toxicity of bupropion is enhanced by the MAOI phenelzine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CONTRAVE increased metoprolol AUC and Cmax by approximately 4- and 2-fold, respectively, relative to metoprolol alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Similar clinical drug interactions resulting in increased pharmacokinetic exposure of CYP2D6 substrates have also been observed with bupropion as a single agent with desipramine or venlafaxine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Coadministration of CONTRAVE with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isozyme including certain antidepressants (SSRIs and many tricyclics), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If CONTRAVE is added to the treatment regimen of a patient already receiving a drug metabolized by CYP2D6, the need to decrease the dose of the original medication should be considered, particularly for those concomitant medications with a narrow therapeutic index.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Inhibitors of CYP2B6: Ticlopidine and Clopidogrel: Concomitant treatment with these drugs can increase bupropion exposure but decrease hydroxybupropion exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During concomitant use with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel), the CONTRAVE daily dose should not exceed two tablets (one tablet each morning and evening).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The systemic concentrations of substrate drugs transported by OCT2 (such as amantadine, amiloride, cimetidine, dopamine, famotidine, memantine, metformin, pindolol, procainamide, ranitidine, varenicline, oxaliplatin) are likely to increase as a result of reduced renal clearance when coadministered with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food Effect on Absorption When CONTRAVE was administered with a high-fat meal, the AUC and Cmax for naltrexone increased 2.1-fold and 3.7-fold, respectively, and the AUC and Cmax for bupropion increased 1.4-fold and 1.8-fold, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	At steady state, the food effect increased AUC and Cmax for naltrexone by 1.7-fold and 1.9-fold, respectively, and increased AUC and Cmax for bupropion by 1.1-fold and 1.3-fold, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thus, CONTRAVE should not be taken with high-fat meals because of the resulting significant increases in bupropion and naltrexone systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In vitro studies suggest that paroxetine, sertraline, norfluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and nelfinavir inhibit the hydroxylation of bupropion.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The systemic concentrations of substrate drugs transported by OCT2 are likely to increase as a result of reduced renal clearance when coadministered with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	In clinical studies, the majority of patients required a decrease in daily levodopa dose if their daily dose of levodopa had been greater than or equal to 800 mg or if patients had moderate or severe dyskinesia before beginning treatment.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	To optimize an individual patient's response, reductions in daily levodopa dose or extending the interval between doses may be necessary.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In clinical studies, the average reduction in daily levodopa dose was about 25% in those patients requiring a levodopa dose reduction (more than 58% of patients with levodopa doses above 800 mg daily required such a reduction).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When entacapone is given in conjunction with levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, such as carbidopa, plasma levels of levodopa are greater and more sustained than after administration of levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is believed that at a given frequency of levodopa administration, these more sustained plasma levels of levodopa result in more constant dopaminergic stimulation in the brain, leading to greater effects on the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When 200 mg entacapone is administered together with levodopa and carbidopa, it increases the area under the curve (AUC) of levodopa by approximately 35%, and the elimination half-life of levodopa is prolonged from 1.3 hours to 2.4 hours.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Lorazepam dosage needs to be reduced by approximately 50% when co-administered with probenecid.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effects of probenecid and valproate on lorazepam may be due to inhibition of glucuronidation.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	An inhibitor of CYP2C8 (e.g., gemfibrozil) significantly increases the exposure (area under the serum concentration-time curve or AUC) and half-life (t1/2) of pioglitazone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of ACTOS is 15 mg daily if used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An inducer of CYP2C8 (e.g., rifampin) may significantly decrease the exposure (AUC) of pioglitazone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A decrease in the exposure of pioglitazone and its active metabolites were noted with concomitant administration of pioglitazone and topiramate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food delays the Tmax to three to four hours but does not alter the extent of absorption (AUC).	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Effects of NUVIGIL on CYP2C19 Substrates Elimination of drugs that are substrates for CYP2C19 (e.g., phenytoin, diazepam, propranolol, omeprazole, and clomipramine) may be prolonged by NUVIGIL via inhibition of metabolic enzymes, with resultant higher systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cyclosporine: blood concentrations of cyclosporine may be reduced.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CYP2C19 substrates, such as omeprazole, phenytoin, and diazepam: exposure of these medications may be increased.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food effect on the overall bioavailability of NUVIGIL is considered minimal; however, time to reach peak concentration (tmax) may be delayed by approximately 2-4 hours in the fed state.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 250 mg resulted in a reduction in systemic exposure to midazolam by 32% after a single oral dose (5 mg) and 17% after a single intravenous dose (2 mg).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the blood levels and effectiveness of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A enzymes (e.g., steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, and triazolam) may be reduced after initiation of concomitant treatment with NUVIGIL.In a separate clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 250 mg with quetiapine (300 mg to 600 mg daily doses) resulted in a reduction in the mean systemic exposure of quetiapine by approximately 29%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 400 mg resulted in a 40% increase in exposure to omeprazole after a single oral dose (40 mg), as a result of moderate inhibition of CYP2C19 activity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Interactions with CNS Active Drugs Concomitant administration of NUVIGIL with quetiapine reduced the systemic exposure of quetiapine.Data specific to NUVIGIL drug-drug interaction potential with other CNS active drugs are not available.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant administration of modafinil with methylphenidate or dextroamphetamine produced no significant alterations on the pharmacokinetic profile of modafinil or either stimulant, even though the absorption of modafinil was delayed for approximately one hour.Concomitant modafinil or clomipramine did not alter the pharmacokinetic profile of either drug; however, one incident of increased levels of clomipramine and its active metabolite desmethylclomipramine was reported in a patient with narcolepsy during treatment with modafinil.Data specific to NUVIGIL or modafinil drug-drug interaction potential with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors are not available.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Barbiturates can induce hepatic microsomal enzymes, resulting in increased metabolism and decreased anticoagulant response of oral anticoagulants (eg, warfarin, acenocoumarol, dicumarol, and phenprocoumon).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Corticosteroids Barbiturates appear to enhance the metabolism of exogenous corticosteroids, probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Griseofulvin Phenobarbital appears to interfere with the absorption of orally administered griseofulvin, thus decreasing its blood level.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effect of the resultant decreased blood levels of griseofulvin on therapeutic response has not been established.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Doxycycline Phenobarbital has been shown to shorten the half-life of doxycycline for as long as 2 weeks after barbiturate therapy is discontinued.This mechanism is probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes that metabolize the antibiotic.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Sodium valproate and valproic acid increase the secobarbital sodium serum levels; therefore, secobarbital sodium blood levels should be monitored closely and appropriate dosage adjustments made as clinically indicated.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Estradiol, Estrone, Progesterone, and Other Steroidal Hormones Pretreatment with or concurrent administration of phenobarbital may decrease the effect of estradiol by increasing its metabolism.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hepatic enzyme-inducing drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone, rifampin) can increase valproate clearance, while enzyme inhibitors (e.g., felbamate) can decrease valproate clearance.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For example, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital (or primidone) can double the clearance of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thus, patients on monotherapy will generally have longer half-lives and higher concentrations than patients receiving polytherapy with antiepilepsy drugs.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drugs for which a potentially important interaction has been observed Aspirin A study involving the co-administration of aspirin at antipyretic doses (11 to 16 mg/kg) with valproate to pediatric patients (n = 6) revealed a decrease in protein binding and an inhibition of metabolism of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	The <U+03B2>-oxidation pathway consisting of 2-E-valproic acid, 3-OH-valproic acid, and 3-keto valproic acid was decreased from 25% of total metabolites excreted on valproate alone to 8.3% in the presence of aspirin.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Increasing the felbamate dose to 2,400 mg/day increased the mean valproate peak concentration to 133 mcg/mL (another 16% increase).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A decrease in valproate dosage may be necessary when felbamate therapy is initiated.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rifampin A study involving the administration of a single dose of valproate (7 mg/kg) 36 hours after 5 nights of daily dosing with rifampin (600 mg) revealed a 40% increase in the oral clearance of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rare postmarketing reports of concurrent use of valproate and amitriptyline resulting in an increased amitriptyline level have been received.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Consideration should be given to lowering the dose of amitriptyline/nortriptyline in the presence of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Carbamazepine/carbamazepine-10,11-Epoxide Serum levels of carbamazepine (CBZ) decreased 17% while that of carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide (CBZ-E) increased by 45% upon co-administration of valproate and CBZ to epileptic patients.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Diazepam Valproate displaces diazepam from its plasma albumin binding sites and inhibits its metabolism.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Administration of a single ethosuximide dose of 500 mg with valproate (800 to 1,600 mg/day) to healthy volunteers (n = 6) was accompanied by a 25% increase in elimination half-life of ethosuximide and a 15% decrease in its total clearance as compared to ethosuximide alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lamotrigine In a steady-state study involving 10 healthy volunteers, the elimination half-life of lamotrigine increased from 26 to 70 hours with valproate co-administration (a 165% increase).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The dose of lamotrigine should be reduced when co-administered with valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Phenobarbital Valproate was found to inhibit the metabolism of phenobarbital.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Co-administration of valproate (250 mg BID for 14 days) with phenobarbital to normal subjects (n = 6) resulted in a 50% increase in half-life and a 30% decrease in plasma clearance of phenobarbital (60 mg single-dose).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The fraction of phenobarbital dose excreted unchanged increased by 50% in presence of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Serum barbiturate concentrations should be obtained, if possible, and the barbiturate dosage decreased, if appropriate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Phenytoin Valproate displaces phenytoin from its plasma albumin binding sites and inhibits its hepatic metabolism.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Co-administration of valproate (400 mg TID) with phenytoin (250 mg) in normal volunteers (n = 7) was associated with a 60% increase in the free fraction of phenytoin.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Total plasma clearance and apparent volume of distribution of phenytoin increased 30% in the presence of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Both the clearance and apparent volume of distribution of free phenytoin were reduced by 25%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Propofol The concomitant use of valproate and propofol may lead to increased blood levels of propofol.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Reduce the dose of propofol when co-administering with valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rufinamide Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, rufinamide clearance was decreased by valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rufinamide concentrations were increased by <16% to 70%, dependent on concentration of valproate (with the larger increases being seen in pediatric patients at high doses or concentrations of valproate).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients stabilized on rufinamide before being prescribed valproate should begin valproate therapy at a low dose, and titrate to a clinically effective dose.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Similarly, patients on valproate should begin at a rufinamide dose lower than 10 mg/kg per day (pediatric patients) or 400 mg per day (adults).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Tolbutamide From in vitro experiments, the unbound fraction of tolbutamide was increased from 20% to 50% when added to plasma samples taken from patients treated with valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Warfarin In an in vitro study, valproate increased the unbound fraction of warfarin by up to 32.6%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Zidovudine In six patients who were seropositive for HIV, the clearance of zidovudine (100 mg q8h) was decreased by 38% after administration of valproate (250 or 500 mg q8h); the half-life of zidovudine was unaffected.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lorazepam Concomitant administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and lorazepam (1 mg BID) in normal male volunteers (n = 9) was accompanied by a 17% decrease in the plasma clearance of lorazepam.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Co-administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and olanzapine (5 mg) to healthy adults (n=10) caused 15% reduction in Cmax and 35% reduction in AUC of olanzapine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Protein binding of valproate is reduced in the elderly, in patients with chronic hepatic diseases, in patients with renal impairment, and in the presence of other drugs (e.g., aspirin).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Conversely, valproate may displace certain protein-bound drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, warfarin, and tolbutamide).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For example, patients taking enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital) will clear valproate more rapidly.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dexamethasone: Steady-state trough concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide were about 56% higher when dexamethasone was coadministered with each dose of albendazole.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Praziquantel: In the fed state increased mean maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve of albendazole sulfoxide by about 50% in healthy subjects.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cimetidine: Increased albendazole sulfoxide concentrations in bile and cystic fluid by about 2-fold in hydatid cyst patients.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Steady-state trough concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide were about 56% higher when 8 mg dexamethasone was co-administered with each dose of albendazole (15 mg/kg/day) in 8 neurocysticercosis patients.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In the fed state, praziquantel (40 mg/kg) increased mean maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve of albendazole sulfoxide by about 50% in healthy subjects (n = 10) compared with a separate group of subjects (n = 6) given albendazole alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Albendazole sulfoxide concentrations in bile and cystic fluid were increased (about 2-fold) in hydatid cyst patients treated with cimetidine (10 mg/kg/day) (n = 7) compared with albendazole (20 mg/kg/day) alone (n = 12).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Oral bioavailability appears to be enhanced when albendazole is coadministered with a fatty meal (estimated fat content 40 grams) as evidenced by higher (up to 5-fold on average) plasma concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide as compared to the fasted state.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, CONTRAVE should not be taken with a high-fat meal because of a resulting significant increase in bupropion and naltrexone systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During concomitant use with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel), the maximum recommended daily dose of CONTRAVE is two tablets (one tablet each morning and evening).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6: Bupropion inhibits CYP2D6 and can increase concentrations of: antidepressants, (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and many tricyclics), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide): Consider dose reduction when using with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant Treatment with CYP2B6 Inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel) can increase bupropion exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Do not exceed one tablet twice daily when taken with CYP2B6 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Studies in animals demonstrate that the acute toxicity of bupropion is enhanced by the MAOI phenelzine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CONTRAVE increased metoprolol AUC and Cmax by approximately 4- and 2-fold, respectively, relative to metoprolol alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Similar clinical drug interactions resulting in increased pharmacokinetic exposure of CYP2D6 substrates have also been observed with bupropion as a single agent with desipramine or venlafaxine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Coadministration of CONTRAVE with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isozyme including certain antidepressants (SSRIs and many tricyclics), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If CONTRAVE is added to the treatment regimen of a patient already receiving a drug metabolized by CYP2D6, the need to decrease the dose of the original medication should be considered, particularly for those concomitant medications with a narrow therapeutic index.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Inhibitors of CYP2B6: Ticlopidine and Clopidogrel: Concomitant treatment with these drugs can increase bupropion exposure but decrease hydroxybupropion exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During concomitant use with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel), the CONTRAVE daily dose should not exceed two tablets (one tablet each morning and evening).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The systemic concentrations of substrate drugs transported by OCT2 (such as amantadine, amiloride, cimetidine, dopamine, famotidine, memantine, metformin, pindolol, procainamide, ranitidine, varenicline, oxaliplatin) are likely to increase as a result of reduced renal clearance when coadministered with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food Effect on Absorption When CONTRAVE was administered with a high-fat meal, the AUC and Cmax for naltrexone increased 2.1-fold and 3.7-fold, respectively, and the AUC and Cmax for bupropion increased 1.4-fold and 1.8-fold, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	At steady state, the food effect increased AUC and Cmax for naltrexone by 1.7-fold and 1.9-fold, respectively, and increased AUC and Cmax for bupropion by 1.1-fold and 1.3-fold, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thus, CONTRAVE should not be taken with high-fat meals because of the resulting significant increases in bupropion and naltrexone systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In vitro studies suggest that paroxetine, sertraline, norfluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and nelfinavir inhibit the hydroxylation of bupropion.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The systemic concentrations of substrate drugs transported by OCT2 are likely to increase as a result of reduced renal clearance when coadministered with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	While not systematically studied, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or phenytoin may induce the metabolism of bupropion.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Chlorpheniramine may inhibit the hepatic metabolism of phenytoin, monitor phenytoin toxicity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The concurrent use of drugs that preferentially induce codeine N-demethylation (via CYP3A4) may increase the plasma concentrations of codeine<U+2019>s inactive metabolite norcodeine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drugs that inhibit codeine O-demethylation (via CYP2D6), may decrease the plasma concentration of codeine<U+2019>s active metabolites, morphine and morphine-6-glucuronide.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Adverse event reports in the literature suggest a possible drug interaction involving increased serum phenytoin levels and phenytoin toxicity when chlorpheniramine and phenytoin are co-administered.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Cimetidine Plus Probenecid: Acyclovir Cmax and AUC following a single dose of VALTREX (1 gram) increased by 30% and 78%, respectively, after a combination of cimetidine and probenecid, primarily due to a reduction in renal clearance of acyclovir.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Probenecid: Acyclovir Cmax and AUC following a single dose of VALTREX (1 gram) increased by 22% and 49%, respectively, after probenecid (1 gram).	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Concomitant administration of rifampin or rifabutin is known to reduce atovaquone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant treatment with tetracycline has been associated with a reduction in plasma concentrations of atovaquone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Concomitant administration of atovaquone and indinavir did not result in any change in the steady<U+2011>state AUC and Cmax of indinavir but resulted in a decrease in the Ctrough of indinavir.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Caution should be exercised when prescribing atovaquone with indinavir due to the decrease in trough concentrations of indinavir.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dietary fat taken with atovaquone increases the rate and extent of absorption, increasing AUC 2 to 3 times and Cmax 5 times over fasting.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rifampin/Rifabutin: Concomitant administration of rifampin or rifabutin is known to reduce atovaquone concentrations by approximately 50% and 34%, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	After oral administration of ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, the mean plasma concentration of orally inhaled mometasone furoate increased.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Caution should be exercised when considering the coadministration of ASMANEX HFA with ketoconazole, and other known strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, cobicistat-containing products, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) because adverse effects related to increased systemic exposure to mometasone furoate may occur.

5	Drugs Dependent on Gastric pH for Absorption (e.g., iron salts, erlotinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, mycophenolate mofetil, ketoconazole/itraconazole) Clinical Impact: Dexlansoprazole can reduce the absorption of other drugs due to its effect on reducing intragastric acidity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Intervention: Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF): Co-administration of PPIs in healthy subjects and in transplant patients receiving MMF has been reported to reduce the exposure to the active metabolite, mycophenolic acid (MPA), possibly due to a decrease in MMF solubility at an increased gastric pH.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than three years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed in patients treated with DEXILANT.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effect on Food In food-effect studies in healthy subjects receiving DEXILANT under various fed conditions compared to fasting, increases in Cmax ranged from 12 to 55%, increases in AUC ranged from 9 to 37%, and Tmax varied (ranging from a decrease of 0.7 hours to an increase of three hours).

5	Lithium generally should not be given with diuretics because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A number of drugs, including ethacrynic acid, have been shown to displace warfarin from plasma protein; a reduction in the usual anticoagulant dosage may be required in patients receiving both drugs.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lithium: Metronidazole has been reported to elevate serum lithium levels.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Simultaneous administration of drugs that inhibit the activity of liver microsomal enzymes, i.e., CYP3A4 inhibitors such as cimetidine and ketoconazole, may prolong the half-life and decrease the plasma clearance of tinidazole, increasing the plasma concentrations of tinidazole.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cholestyramine: Cholestyramine was shown to decrease the oral bioavailability of metronidazole by 21%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Administration of Tindamax tablets with food resulted in a delay in T max of approximately 2 hours and a decline in Cmax of approximately 10%, compared to fasted conditions.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In clinical studies, the majority of patients required a decrease in daily levodopa dose if their daily dose of levodopa had been greater than or equal to 800 mg or if patients had moderate or severe dyskinesia before beginning treatment.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	To optimize an individual patient's response, reductions in daily levodopa dose or extending the interval between doses may be necessary.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In clinical studies, the average reduction in daily levodopa dose was about 25% in those patients requiring a levodopa dose reduction (more than 58% of patients with levodopa doses above 800 mg daily required such a reduction).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When entacapone is given in conjunction with levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, such as carbidopa, plasma levels of levodopa are greater and more sustained than after administration of levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is believed that at a given frequency of levodopa administration, these more sustained plasma levels of levodopa result in more constant dopaminergic stimulation in the brain, leading to greater effects on the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When 200 mg entacapone is administered together with levodopa and carbidopa, it increases the area under the curve (AUC) of levodopa by approximately 35%, and the elimination half-life of levodopa is prolonged from 1.3 hours to 2.4 hours.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When colesevelam is coadministered with glipizide ER, maximum plasma concentration and total exposure to glipizide is reduced.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The mean percentage increase in the GLUCOTROL AUC after fluconazole administration was 56.9% (range: 35 to 81).	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Therefore, GLUCOTROL should be administered at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam to ensure that colesevelam does not reduce the absorption of glipizide.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Total absorption and disposition of an oral dose was unaffected by food in normal volunteers, but absorption was delayed by about 40 minutes.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concurrent administration of lorazepam with valproate results in increased plasma concentrations and reduced clearance of lorazepam.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lorazepam dosage should be reduced to approximately 50% when co-administered with valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concurrent administration of lorazepam with probenecid may result in a more rapid onset or prolonged effect of lorazepam due to increased half-life and decreased total clearance.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lorazepam dosage needs to be reduced by approximately 50% when co-administered with probenecid.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effects of probenecid and valproate on lorazepam may be due to inhibition of glucuronidation.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Continue until methotrexate level is below 5 x 10-8 M (0.05 micromolar).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Continue Levoleucovorin for injection administration, hydration, and urinary alkalinization (pH 7.0 or greater) until the methotrexate level is below 5 x 10-8 M (0.05 micromolar).	Pharmacokinetic interaction

Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In addition to appropriate levoleucovorin for injection therapy, continue hydration and urinary alkalinization, and monitoring of fluid and electrolyte status, until the serum methotrexate level has fallen to below 0.05 micromolar and the renal failure has resolved.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effect of leu co vorin products on fluorouracil : Leucovorin products increase the toxicity of fluorouracil.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Leucovorin products increase the toxicities of fluorouracil.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Coadministration of ACTOS and gemfibrozil, a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, increases pioglitazone exposure approximately 3-fold.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of ACTOS is 15 mg daily when used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Strong CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g., gemfibrozil) increase pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CYP2C8 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may decrease pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Topiramate may decrease pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An inhibitor of CYP2C8 (e.g., gemfibrozil) significantly increases the exposure (area under the serum concentration-time curve or AUC) and half-life (t1/2) of pioglitazone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of ACTOS is 15 mg daily if used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An inducer of CYP2C8 (e.g., rifampin) may significantly decrease the exposure (AUC) of pioglitazone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A decrease in the exposure of pioglitazone and its active metabolites were noted with concomitant administration of pioglitazone and topiramate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food delays the Tmax to three to four hours but does not alter the extent of absorption (AUC).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In an in vitro study in human liver microsomes, inhibition of CYP2A6 hydroxylation of coumarin by fondaparinux (200 micromolar i.e., 350 mg/L) was 17 to 28%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effects of NUVIGIL on CYP3A4/5 Substrates The clearance of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A4/5 (e.g., steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, and triazolam) may be increased by NUVIGIL via induction of metabolic enzymes, which results in lower systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Blood levels of cyclosporine may be reduced when used with NUVIGIL.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effects of NUVIGIL on CYP2C19 Substrates Elimination of drugs that are substrates for CYP2C19 (e.g., phenytoin, diazepam, propranolol, omeprazole, and clomipramine) may be prolonged by NUVIGIL via inhibition of metabolic enzymes, with resultant higher systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cyclosporine: blood concentrations of cyclosporine may be reduced.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CYP2C19 substrates, such as omeprazole, phenytoin, and diazepam: exposure of these medications may be increased.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food effect on the overall bioavailability of NUVIGIL is considered minimal; however, time to reach peak concentration (tmax) may be delayed by approximately 2-4 hours in the fed state.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 250 mg resulted in a reduction in systemic exposure to midazolam by 32% after a single oral dose (5 mg) and 17% after a single intravenous dose (2 mg).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the blood levels and effectiveness of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A enzymes (e.g., steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, and triazolam) may be reduced after initiation of concomitant treatment with NUVIGIL.In a separate clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 250 mg with quetiapine (300 mg to 600 mg daily doses) resulted in a reduction in the mean systemic exposure of quetiapine by approximately 29%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 400 mg resulted in a 40% increase in exposure to omeprazole after a single oral dose (40 mg), as a result of moderate inhibition of CYP2C19 activity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Interactions with CNS Active Drugs Concomitant administration of NUVIGIL with quetiapine reduced the systemic exposure of quetiapine.Data specific to NUVIGIL drug-drug interaction potential with other CNS active drugs are not available.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant administration of modafinil with methylphenidate or dextroamphetamine produced no significant alterations on the pharmacokinetic profile of modafinil or either stimulant, even though the absorption of modafinil was delayed for approximately one hour.Concomitant modafinil or clomipramine did not alter the pharmacokinetic profile of either drug; however, one incident of increased levels of clomipramine and its active metabolite desmethylclomipramine was reported in a patient with narcolepsy during treatment with modafinil.Data specific to NUVIGIL or modafinil drug-drug interaction potential with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors are not available.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Barbiturates can induce hepatic microsomal enzymes, resulting in increased metabolism and decreased anticoagulant response of oral anticoagulants (eg, warfarin, acenocoumarol, dicumarol, and phenprocoumon).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Corticosteroids Barbiturates appear to enhance the metabolism of exogenous corticosteroids, probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Griseofulvin Phenobarbital appears to interfere with the absorption of orally administered griseofulvin, thus decreasing its blood level.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effect of the resultant decreased blood levels of griseofulvin on therapeutic response has not been established.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Doxycycline Phenobarbital has been shown to shorten the half-life of doxycycline for as long as 2 weeks after barbiturate therapy is discontinued.This mechanism is probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes that metabolize the antibiotic.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Sodium valproate and valproic acid increase the secobarbital sodium serum levels; therefore, secobarbital sodium blood levels should be monitored closely and appropriate dosage adjustments made as clinically indicated.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Estradiol, Estrone, Progesterone, and Other Steroidal Hormones Pretreatment with or concurrent administration of phenobarbital may decrease the effect of estradiol by increasing its metabolism.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hepatic enzyme-inducing drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone, rifampin) can increase valproate clearance, while enzyme inhibitors (e.g., felbamate) can decrease valproate clearance.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For example, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital (or primidone) can double the clearance of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thus, patients on monotherapy will generally have longer half-lives and higher concentrations than patients receiving polytherapy with antiepilepsy drugs.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	The <U+03B2>-oxidation pathway consisting of 2-E-valproic acid, 3-OH-valproic acid, and 3-keto valproic acid was decreased from 25% of total metabolites excreted on valproate alone to 8.3% in the presence of aspirin.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Increasing the felbamate dose to 2,400 mg/day increased the mean valproate peak concentration to 133 mcg/mL (another 16% increase).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A decrease in valproate dosage may be necessary when felbamate therapy is initiated.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rifampin A study involving the administration of a single dose of valproate (7 mg/kg) 36 hours after 5 nights of daily dosing with rifampin (600 mg) revealed a 40% increase in the oral clearance of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rare postmarketing reports of concurrent use of valproate and amitriptyline resulting in an increased amitriptyline level have been received.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Consideration should be given to lowering the dose of amitriptyline/nortriptyline in the presence of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Carbamazepine/carbamazepine-10,11-Epoxide Serum levels of carbamazepine (CBZ) decreased 17% while that of carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide (CBZ-E) increased by 45% upon co-administration of valproate and CBZ to epileptic patients.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lamotrigine In a steady-state study involving 10 healthy volunteers, the elimination half-life of lamotrigine increased from 26 to 70 hours with valproate co-administration (a 165% increase).	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Phenobarbital Valproate was found to inhibit the metabolism of phenobarbital.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Co-administration of valproate (250 mg BID for 14 days) with phenobarbital to normal subjects (n = 6) resulted in a 50% increase in half-life and a 30% decrease in plasma clearance of phenobarbital (60 mg single-dose).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The fraction of phenobarbital dose excreted unchanged increased by 50% in presence of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Serum barbiturate concentrations should be obtained, if possible, and the barbiturate dosage decreased, if appropriate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Both the clearance and apparent volume of distribution of free phenytoin were reduced by 25%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Propofol The concomitant use of valproate and propofol may lead to increased blood levels of propofol.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Reduce the dose of propofol when co-administering with valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rufinamide Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, rufinamide clearance was decreased by valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rufinamide concentrations were increased by <16% to 70%, dependent on concentration of valproate (with the larger increases being seen in pediatric patients at high doses or concentrations of valproate).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients stabilized on rufinamide before being prescribed valproate should begin valproate therapy at a low dose, and titrate to a clinically effective dose.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Similarly, patients on valproate should begin at a rufinamide dose lower than 10 mg/kg per day (pediatric patients) or 400 mg per day (adults).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Tolbutamide From in vitro experiments, the unbound fraction of tolbutamide was increased from 20% to 50% when added to plasma samples taken from patients treated with valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Zidovudine In six patients who were seropositive for HIV, the clearance of zidovudine (100 mg q8h) was decreased by 38% after administration of valproate (250 or 500 mg q8h); the half-life of zidovudine was unaffected.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lorazepam Concomitant administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and lorazepam (1 mg BID) in normal male volunteers (n = 9) was accompanied by a 17% decrease in the plasma clearance of lorazepam.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Co-administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and olanzapine (5 mg) to healthy adults (n=10) caused 15% reduction in Cmax and 35% reduction in AUC of olanzapine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Protein binding of valproate is reduced in the elderly, in patients with chronic hepatic diseases, in patients with renal impairment, and in the presence of other drugs (e.g., aspirin).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Conversely, valproate may displace certain protein-bound drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, warfarin, and tolbutamide).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For example, patients taking enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital) will clear valproate more rapidly.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	In the fed state, praziquantel (40 mg/kg) increased mean maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve of albendazole sulfoxide by about 50% in healthy subjects (n = 10) compared with a separate group of subjects (n = 6) given albendazole alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Albendazole sulfoxide concentrations in bile and cystic fluid were increased (about 2-fold) in hydatid cyst patients treated with cimetidine (10 mg/kg/day) (n = 7) compared with albendazole (20 mg/kg/day) alone (n = 12).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Oral bioavailability appears to be enhanced when albendazole is coadministered with a fatty meal (estimated fat content 40 grams) as evidenced by higher (up to 5-fold on average) plasma concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide as compared to the fasted state.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, CONTRAVE should not be taken with a high-fat meal because of a resulting significant increase in bupropion and naltrexone systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During concomitant use with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel), the maximum recommended daily dose of CONTRAVE is two tablets (one tablet each morning and evening).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6: Bupropion inhibits CYP2D6 and can increase concentrations of: antidepressants, (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and many tricyclics), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide): Consider dose reduction when using with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant Treatment with CYP2B6 Inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel) can increase bupropion exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Do not exceed one tablet twice daily when taken with CYP2B6 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Studies in animals demonstrate that the acute toxicity of bupropion is enhanced by the MAOI phenelzine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CONTRAVE increased metoprolol AUC and Cmax by approximately 4- and 2-fold, respectively, relative to metoprolol alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Similar clinical drug interactions resulting in increased pharmacokinetic exposure of CYP2D6 substrates have also been observed with bupropion as a single agent with desipramine or venlafaxine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Coadministration of CONTRAVE with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isozyme including certain antidepressants (SSRIs and many tricyclics), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If CONTRAVE is added to the treatment regimen of a patient already receiving a drug metabolized by CYP2D6, the need to decrease the dose of the original medication should be considered, particularly for those concomitant medications with a narrow therapeutic index.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Inhibitors of CYP2B6: Ticlopidine and Clopidogrel: Concomitant treatment with these drugs can increase bupropion exposure but decrease hydroxybupropion exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During concomitant use with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel), the CONTRAVE daily dose should not exceed two tablets (one tablet each morning and evening).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The systemic concentrations of substrate drugs transported by OCT2 (such as amantadine, amiloride, cimetidine, dopamine, famotidine, memantine, metformin, pindolol, procainamide, ranitidine, varenicline, oxaliplatin) are likely to increase as a result of reduced renal clearance when coadministered with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food Effect on Absorption When CONTRAVE was administered with a high-fat meal, the AUC and Cmax for naltrexone increased 2.1-fold and 3.7-fold, respectively, and the AUC and Cmax for bupropion increased 1.4-fold and 1.8-fold, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	At steady state, the food effect increased AUC and Cmax for naltrexone by 1.7-fold and 1.9-fold, respectively, and increased AUC and Cmax for bupropion by 1.1-fold and 1.3-fold, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thus, CONTRAVE should not be taken with high-fat meals because of the resulting significant increases in bupropion and naltrexone systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In vitro studies suggest that paroxetine, sertraline, norfluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and nelfinavir inhibit the hydroxylation of bupropion.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The systemic concentrations of substrate drugs transported by OCT2 are likely to increase as a result of reduced renal clearance when coadministered with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	In clinical studies, the majority of patients required a decrease in daily levodopa dose if their daily dose of levodopa had been greater than or equal to 800 mg or if patients had moderate or severe dyskinesia before beginning treatment.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	To optimize an individual patient's response, reductions in daily levodopa dose or extending the interval between doses may be necessary.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In clinical studies, the average reduction in daily levodopa dose was about 25% in those patients requiring a levodopa dose reduction (more than 58% of patients with levodopa doses above 800 mg daily required such a reduction).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When entacapone is given in conjunction with levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, such as carbidopa, plasma levels of levodopa are greater and more sustained than after administration of levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is believed that at a given frequency of levodopa administration, these more sustained plasma levels of levodopa result in more constant dopaminergic stimulation in the brain, leading to greater effects on the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When 200 mg entacapone is administered together with levodopa and carbidopa, it increases the area under the curve (AUC) of levodopa by approximately 35%, and the elimination half-life of levodopa is prolonged from 1.3 hours to 2.4 hours.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Effects of NUVIGIL on CYP3A4/5 Substrates The clearance of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A4/5 (e.g., steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, and triazolam) may be increased by NUVIGIL via induction of metabolic enzymes, which results in lower systemic exposure.

5	In a clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 250 mg resulted in a reduction in systemic exposure to midazolam by 32% after a single oral dose (5 mg) and 17% after a single intravenous dose (2 mg).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the blood levels and effectiveness of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A enzymes (e.g., steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, and triazolam) may be reduced after initiation of concomitant treatment with NUVIGIL.In a separate clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 250 mg with quetiapine (300 mg to 600 mg daily doses) resulted in a reduction in the mean systemic exposure of quetiapine by approximately 29%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 400 mg resulted in a 40% increase in exposure to omeprazole after a single oral dose (40 mg), as a result of moderate inhibition of CYP2C19 activity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	The effect of the resultant decreased blood levels of griseofulvin on therapeutic response has not been established.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Doxycycline Phenobarbital has been shown to shorten the half-life of doxycycline for as long as 2 weeks after barbiturate therapy is discontinued.This mechanism is probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes that metabolize the antibiotic.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Sodium valproate and valproic acid increase the secobarbital sodium serum levels; therefore, secobarbital sodium blood levels should be monitored closely and appropriate dosage adjustments made as clinically indicated.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Estradiol, Estrone, Progesterone, and Other Steroidal Hormones Pretreatment with or concurrent administration of phenobarbital may decrease the effect of estradiol by increasing its metabolism.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Albendazole sulfoxide concentrations in bile and cystic fluid were increased (about 2-fold) in hydatid cyst patients treated with cimetidine (10 mg/kg/day) (n = 7) compared with albendazole (20 mg/kg/day) alone (n = 12).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Oral bioavailability appears to be enhanced when albendazole is coadministered with a fatty meal (estimated fat content 40 grams) as evidenced by higher (up to 5-fold on average) plasma concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide as compared to the fasted state.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, CONTRAVE should not be taken with a high-fat meal because of a resulting significant increase in bupropion and naltrexone systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During concomitant use with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel), the maximum recommended daily dose of CONTRAVE is two tablets (one tablet each morning and evening).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6: Bupropion inhibits CYP2D6 and can increase concentrations of: antidepressants, (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and many tricyclics), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide): Consider dose reduction when using with CONTRAVE.

5	Do not exceed one tablet twice daily when taken with CYP2B6 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Studies in animals demonstrate that the acute toxicity of bupropion is enhanced by the MAOI phenelzine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CONTRAVE increased metoprolol AUC and Cmax by approximately 4- and 2-fold, respectively, relative to metoprolol alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Similar clinical drug interactions resulting in increased pharmacokinetic exposure of CYP2D6 substrates have also been observed with bupropion as a single agent with desipramine or venlafaxine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Coadministration of CONTRAVE with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isozyme including certain antidepressants (SSRIs and many tricyclics), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If CONTRAVE is added to the treatment regimen of a patient already receiving a drug metabolized by CYP2D6, the need to decrease the dose of the original medication should be considered, particularly for those concomitant medications with a narrow therapeutic index.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Inhibitors of CYP2B6: Ticlopidine and Clopidogrel: Concomitant treatment with these drugs can increase bupropion exposure but decrease hydroxybupropion exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	The systemic concentrations of substrate drugs transported by OCT2 (such as amantadine, amiloride, cimetidine, dopamine, famotidine, memantine, metformin, pindolol, procainamide, ranitidine, varenicline, oxaliplatin) are likely to increase as a result of reduced renal clearance when coadministered with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food Effect on Absorption When CONTRAVE was administered with a high-fat meal, the AUC and Cmax for naltrexone increased 2.1-fold and 3.7-fold, respectively, and the AUC and Cmax for bupropion increased 1.4-fold and 1.8-fold, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	At steady state, the food effect increased AUC and Cmax for naltrexone by 1.7-fold and 1.9-fold, respectively, and increased AUC and Cmax for bupropion by 1.1-fold and 1.3-fold, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thus, CONTRAVE should not be taken with high-fat meals because of the resulting significant increases in bupropion and naltrexone systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In vitro studies suggest that paroxetine, sertraline, norfluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and nelfinavir inhibit the hydroxylation of bupropion.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The systemic concentrations of substrate drugs transported by OCT2 are likely to increase as a result of reduced renal clearance when coadministered with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	While not systematically studied, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or phenytoin may induce the metabolism of bupropion.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Chlorpheniramine may inhibit the hepatic metabolism of phenytoin, monitor phenytoin toxicity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Cimetidine Plus Probenecid: Acyclovir Cmax and AUC following a single dose of VALTREX (1 gram) increased by 30% and 78%, respectively, after a combination of cimetidine and probenecid, primarily due to a reduction in renal clearance of acyclovir.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	In clinical studies, the majority of patients required a decrease in daily levodopa dose if their daily dose of levodopa had been greater than or equal to 800 mg or if patients had moderate or severe dyskinesia before beginning treatment.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	To optimize an individual patient's response, reductions in daily levodopa dose or extending the interval between doses may be necessary.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In clinical studies, the average reduction in daily levodopa dose was about 25% in those patients requiring a levodopa dose reduction (more than 58% of patients with levodopa doses above 800 mg daily required such a reduction).	Pharmacokinetic interaction

Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is believed that at a given frequency of levodopa administration, these more sustained plasma levels of levodopa result in more constant dopaminergic stimulation in the brain, leading to greater effects on the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When 200 mg entacapone is administered together with levodopa and carbidopa, it increases the area under the curve (AUC) of levodopa by approximately 35%, and the elimination half-life of levodopa is prolonged from 1.3 hours to 2.4 hours.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Lorazepam dosage needs to be reduced by approximately 50% when co-administered with probenecid.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effects of probenecid and valproate on lorazepam may be due to inhibition of glucuronidation.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In addition to appropriate levoleucovorin for injection therapy, continue hydration and urinary alkalinization, and monitoring of fluid and electrolyte status, until the serum methotrexate level has fallen to below 0.05 micromolar and the renal failure has resolved.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Strong CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g., gemfibrozil) increase pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CYP2C8 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may decrease pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Topiramate may decrease pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An inhibitor of CYP2C8 (e.g., gemfibrozil) significantly increases the exposure (area under the serum concentration-time curve or AUC) and half-life (t1/2) of pioglitazone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of ACTOS is 15 mg daily if used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An inducer of CYP2C8 (e.g., rifampin) may significantly decrease the exposure (AUC) of pioglitazone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A decrease in the exposure of pioglitazone and its active metabolites were noted with concomitant administration of pioglitazone and topiramate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food delays the Tmax to three to four hours but does not alter the extent of absorption (AUC).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In an in vitro study in human liver microsomes, inhibition of CYP2A6 hydroxylation of coumarin by fondaparinux (200 micromolar i.e., 350 mg/L) was 17 to 28%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effects of NUVIGIL on CYP3A4/5 Substrates The clearance of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A4/5 (e.g., steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, and triazolam) may be increased by NUVIGIL via induction of metabolic enzymes, which results in lower systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Blood levels of cyclosporine may be reduced when used with NUVIGIL.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effects of NUVIGIL on CYP2C19 Substrates Elimination of drugs that are substrates for CYP2C19 (e.g., phenytoin, diazepam, propranolol, omeprazole, and clomipramine) may be prolonged by NUVIGIL via inhibition of metabolic enzymes, with resultant higher systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cyclosporine: blood concentrations of cyclosporine may be reduced.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CYP2C19 substrates, such as omeprazole, phenytoin, and diazepam: exposure of these medications may be increased.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food effect on the overall bioavailability of NUVIGIL is considered minimal; however, time to reach peak concentration (tmax) may be delayed by approximately 2-4 hours in the fed state.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 250 mg resulted in a reduction in systemic exposure to midazolam by 32% after a single oral dose (5 mg) and 17% after a single intravenous dose (2 mg).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the blood levels and effectiveness of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A enzymes (e.g., steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, and triazolam) may be reduced after initiation of concomitant treatment with NUVIGIL.In a separate clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 250 mg with quetiapine (300 mg to 600 mg daily doses) resulted in a reduction in the mean systemic exposure of quetiapine by approximately 29%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 400 mg resulted in a 40% increase in exposure to omeprazole after a single oral dose (40 mg), as a result of moderate inhibition of CYP2C19 activity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Interactions with CNS Active Drugs Concomitant administration of NUVIGIL with quetiapine reduced the systemic exposure of quetiapine.Data specific to NUVIGIL drug-drug interaction potential with other CNS active drugs are not available.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant administration of modafinil with methylphenidate or dextroamphetamine produced no significant alterations on the pharmacokinetic profile of modafinil or either stimulant, even though the absorption of modafinil was delayed for approximately one hour.Concomitant modafinil or clomipramine did not alter the pharmacokinetic profile of either drug; however, one incident of increased levels of clomipramine and its active metabolite desmethylclomipramine was reported in a patient with narcolepsy during treatment with modafinil.Data specific to NUVIGIL or modafinil drug-drug interaction potential with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors are not available.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Barbiturates can induce hepatic microsomal enzymes, resulting in increased metabolism and decreased anticoagulant response of oral anticoagulants (eg, warfarin, acenocoumarol, dicumarol, and phenprocoumon).	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Doxycycline Phenobarbital has been shown to shorten the half-life of doxycycline for as long as 2 weeks after barbiturate therapy is discontinued.This mechanism is probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes that metabolize the antibiotic.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Sodium valproate and valproic acid increase the secobarbital sodium serum levels; therefore, secobarbital sodium blood levels should be monitored closely and appropriate dosage adjustments made as clinically indicated.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Estradiol, Estrone, Progesterone, and Other Steroidal Hormones Pretreatment with or concurrent administration of phenobarbital may decrease the effect of estradiol by increasing its metabolism.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hepatic enzyme-inducing drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone, rifampin) can increase valproate clearance, while enzyme inhibitors (e.g., felbamate) can decrease valproate clearance.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For example, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital (or primidone) can double the clearance of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Rufinamide concentrations were increased by <16% to 70%, dependent on concentration of valproate (with the larger increases being seen in pediatric patients at high doses or concentrations of valproate).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients stabilized on rufinamide before being prescribed valproate should begin valproate therapy at a low dose, and titrate to a clinically effective dose.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Similarly, patients on valproate should begin at a rufinamide dose lower than 10 mg/kg per day (pediatric patients) or 400 mg per day (adults).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Tolbutamide From in vitro experiments, the unbound fraction of tolbutamide was increased from 20% to 50% when added to plasma samples taken from patients treated with valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Warfarin In an in vitro study, valproate increased the unbound fraction of warfarin by up to 32.6%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Zidovudine In six patients who were seropositive for HIV, the clearance of zidovudine (100 mg q8h) was decreased by 38% after administration of valproate (250 or 500 mg q8h); the half-life of zidovudine was unaffected.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lorazepam Concomitant administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and lorazepam (1 mg BID) in normal male volunteers (n = 9) was accompanied by a 17% decrease in the plasma clearance of lorazepam.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Co-administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and olanzapine (5 mg) to healthy adults (n=10) caused 15% reduction in Cmax and 35% reduction in AUC of olanzapine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Protein binding of valproate is reduced in the elderly, in patients with chronic hepatic diseases, in patients with renal impairment, and in the presence of other drugs (e.g., aspirin).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Conversely, valproate may displace certain protein-bound drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, warfarin, and tolbutamide).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For example, patients taking enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital) will clear valproate more rapidly.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dexamethasone: Steady-state trough concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide were about 56% higher when dexamethasone was coadministered with each dose of albendazole.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Praziquantel: In the fed state increased mean maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve of albendazole sulfoxide by about 50% in healthy subjects.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cimetidine: Increased albendazole sulfoxide concentrations in bile and cystic fluid by about 2-fold in hydatid cyst patients.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Steady-state trough concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide were about 56% higher when 8 mg dexamethasone was co-administered with each dose of albendazole (15 mg/kg/day) in 8 neurocysticercosis patients.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In the fed state, praziquantel (40 mg/kg) increased mean maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve of albendazole sulfoxide by about 50% in healthy subjects (n = 10) compared with a separate group of subjects (n = 6) given albendazole alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Albendazole sulfoxide concentrations in bile and cystic fluid were increased (about 2-fold) in hydatid cyst patients treated with cimetidine (10 mg/kg/day) (n = 7) compared with albendazole (20 mg/kg/day) alone (n = 12).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Oral bioavailability appears to be enhanced when albendazole is coadministered with a fatty meal (estimated fat content 40 grams) as evidenced by higher (up to 5-fold on average) plasma concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide as compared to the fasted state.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, CONTRAVE should not be taken with a high-fat meal because of a resulting significant increase in bupropion and naltrexone systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During concomitant use with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel), the maximum recommended daily dose of CONTRAVE is two tablets (one tablet each morning and evening).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6: Bupropion inhibits CYP2D6 and can increase concentrations of: antidepressants, (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and many tricyclics), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide): Consider dose reduction when using with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant Treatment with CYP2B6 Inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel) can increase bupropion exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Do not exceed one tablet twice daily when taken with CYP2B6 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Studies in animals demonstrate that the acute toxicity of bupropion is enhanced by the MAOI phenelzine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CONTRAVE increased metoprolol AUC and Cmax by approximately 4- and 2-fold, respectively, relative to metoprolol alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Similar clinical drug interactions resulting in increased pharmacokinetic exposure of CYP2D6 substrates have also been observed with bupropion as a single agent with desipramine or venlafaxine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Coadministration of CONTRAVE with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isozyme including certain antidepressants (SSRIs and many tricyclics), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If CONTRAVE is added to the treatment regimen of a patient already receiving a drug metabolized by CYP2D6, the need to decrease the dose of the original medication should be considered, particularly for those concomitant medications with a narrow therapeutic index.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Inhibitors of CYP2B6: Ticlopidine and Clopidogrel: Concomitant treatment with these drugs can increase bupropion exposure but decrease hydroxybupropion exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During concomitant use with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel), the CONTRAVE daily dose should not exceed two tablets (one tablet each morning and evening).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The systemic concentrations of substrate drugs transported by OCT2 (such as amantadine, amiloride, cimetidine, dopamine, famotidine, memantine, metformin, pindolol, procainamide, ranitidine, varenicline, oxaliplatin) are likely to increase as a result of reduced renal clearance when coadministered with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food Effect on Absorption When CONTRAVE was administered with a high-fat meal, the AUC and Cmax for naltrexone increased 2.1-fold and 3.7-fold, respectively, and the AUC and Cmax for bupropion increased 1.4-fold and 1.8-fold, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	At steady state, the food effect increased AUC and Cmax for naltrexone by 1.7-fold and 1.9-fold, respectively, and increased AUC and Cmax for bupropion by 1.1-fold and 1.3-fold, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thus, CONTRAVE should not be taken with high-fat meals because of the resulting significant increases in bupropion and naltrexone systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In vitro studies suggest that paroxetine, sertraline, norfluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and nelfinavir inhibit the hydroxylation of bupropion.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The systemic concentrations of substrate drugs transported by OCT2 are likely to increase as a result of reduced renal clearance when coadministered with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	While not systematically studied, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or phenytoin may induce the metabolism of bupropion.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Chlorpheniramine may inhibit the hepatic metabolism of phenytoin, monitor phenytoin toxicity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Cimetidine Plus Probenecid: Acyclovir Cmax and AUC following a single dose of VALTREX (1 gram) increased by 30% and 78%, respectively, after a combination of cimetidine and probenecid, primarily due to a reduction in renal clearance of acyclovir.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Probenecid: Acyclovir Cmax and AUC following a single dose of VALTREX (1 gram) increased by 22% and 49%, respectively, after probenecid (1 gram).	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	CYP3A4 Inducers and Inhibitors: Simultaneous administration of tinidazole with drugs that induce liver microsomal enzymes, i.e., CYP3A4 inducers such as phenobarbital, rifampin, phenytoin, and fosphenytoin (a pro-drug of phenytoin), may accelerate the elimination of tinidazole, decreasing the plasma level of tinidazole.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Simultaneous administration of drugs that inhibit the activity of liver microsomal enzymes, i.e., CYP3A4 inhibitors such as cimetidine and ketoconazole, may prolong the half-life and decrease the plasma clearance of tinidazole, increasing the plasma concentrations of tinidazole.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cholestyramine: Cholestyramine was shown to decrease the oral bioavailability of metronidazole by 21%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Administration of Tindamax tablets with food resulted in a delay in T max of approximately 2 hours and a decline in Cmax of approximately 10%, compared to fasted conditions.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In clinical studies, the majority of patients required a decrease in daily levodopa dose if their daily dose of levodopa had been greater than or equal to 800 mg or if patients had moderate or severe dyskinesia before beginning treatment.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	To optimize an individual patient's response, reductions in daily levodopa dose or extending the interval between doses may be necessary.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In clinical studies, the average reduction in daily levodopa dose was about 25% in those patients requiring a levodopa dose reduction (more than 58% of patients with levodopa doses above 800 mg daily required such a reduction).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When entacapone is given in conjunction with levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, such as carbidopa, plasma levels of levodopa are greater and more sustained than after administration of levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is believed that at a given frequency of levodopa administration, these more sustained plasma levels of levodopa result in more constant dopaminergic stimulation in the brain, leading to greater effects on the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When 200 mg entacapone is administered together with levodopa and carbidopa, it increases the area under the curve (AUC) of levodopa by approximately 35%, and the elimination half-life of levodopa is prolonged from 1.3 hours to 2.4 hours.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When colesevelam is coadministered with glipizide ER, maximum plasma concentration and total exposure to glipizide is reduced.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The mean percentage increase in the GLUCOTROL AUC after fluconazole administration was 56.9% (range: 35 to 81).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In studies assessing the effect of colesevelam on the pharmacokinetics of glipizide ER in healthy volunteers, reductions in glipizide AUC0<U+2013><U+221E> and Cmax of 12% and 13%, respectively were observed when colesevelam was coadministered with glipizide ER.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, GLUCOTROL should be administered at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam to ensure that colesevelam does not reduce the absorption of glipizide.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Total absorption and disposition of an oral dose was unaffected by food in normal volunteers, but absorption was delayed by about 40 minutes.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concurrent administration of lorazepam with valproate results in increased plasma concentrations and reduced clearance of lorazepam.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lorazepam dosage should be reduced to approximately 50% when co-administered with valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concurrent administration of lorazepam with probenecid may result in a more rapid onset or prolonged effect of lorazepam due to increased half-life and decreased total clearance.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lorazepam dosage needs to be reduced by approximately 50% when co-administered with probenecid.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effects of probenecid and valproate on lorazepam may be due to inhibition of glucuronidation.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Continue until methotrexate level is below 5 x 10-8 M (0.05 micromolar).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Continue Levoleucovorin for injection administration, hydration, and urinary alkalinization (pH 7.0 or greater) until the methotrexate level is below 5 x 10-8 M (0.05 micromolar).	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Continue 7.5 mg by intravenous infusion every 6 hours, until methotrexate level is less than 0.05 micromolar.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Delayed early methotrexate elimination and/or evidence of acute renal injury* Serum methotrexate level of 50 micromolar or more at 24 hours, or 5 micromolar or more at 48 hours after administration, OR 100% or greater increase in serum creatinine level at 24 hours after methotrexate administration (e.g., an increase from 0.5 mg/dL to a level of 1 mg/dL or more).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In addition to appropriate levoleucovorin for injection therapy, continue hydration and urinary alkalinization, and monitoring of fluid and electrolyte status, until the serum methotrexate level has fallen to below 0.05 micromolar and the renal failure has resolved.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effect of leu co vorin products on fluorouracil : Leucovorin products increase the toxicity of fluorouracil.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Leucovorin products increase the toxicities of fluorouracil.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Coadministration of ACTOS and gemfibrozil, a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, increases pioglitazone exposure approximately 3-fold.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of ACTOS is 15 mg daily when used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Strong CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g., gemfibrozil) increase pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CYP2C8 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may decrease pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Topiramate may decrease pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An inhibitor of CYP2C8 (e.g., gemfibrozil) significantly increases the exposure (area under the serum concentration-time curve or AUC) and half-life (t1/2) of pioglitazone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of ACTOS is 15 mg daily if used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An inducer of CYP2C8 (e.g., rifampin) may significantly decrease the exposure (AUC) of pioglitazone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A decrease in the exposure of pioglitazone and its active metabolites were noted with concomitant administration of pioglitazone and topiramate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food delays the Tmax to three to four hours but does not alter the extent of absorption (AUC).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In an in vitro study in human liver microsomes, inhibition of CYP2A6 hydroxylation of coumarin by fondaparinux (200 micromolar i.e., 350 mg/L) was 17 to 28%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effects of NUVIGIL on CYP3A4/5 Substrates The clearance of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A4/5 (e.g., steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, and triazolam) may be increased by NUVIGIL via induction of metabolic enzymes, which results in lower systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Blood levels of cyclosporine may be reduced when used with NUVIGIL.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effects of NUVIGIL on CYP2C19 Substrates Elimination of drugs that are substrates for CYP2C19 (e.g., phenytoin, diazepam, propranolol, omeprazole, and clomipramine) may be prolonged by NUVIGIL via inhibition of metabolic enzymes, with resultant higher systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cyclosporine: blood concentrations of cyclosporine may be reduced.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CYP2C19 substrates, such as omeprazole, phenytoin, and diazepam: exposure of these medications may be increased.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food effect on the overall bioavailability of NUVIGIL is considered minimal; however, time to reach peak concentration (tmax) may be delayed by approximately 2-4 hours in the fed state.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 250 mg resulted in a reduction in systemic exposure to midazolam by 32% after a single oral dose (5 mg) and 17% after a single intravenous dose (2 mg).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the blood levels and effectiveness of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A enzymes (e.g., steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, and triazolam) may be reduced after initiation of concomitant treatment with NUVIGIL.In a separate clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 250 mg with quetiapine (300 mg to 600 mg daily doses) resulted in a reduction in the mean systemic exposure of quetiapine by approximately 29%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 400 mg resulted in a 40% increase in exposure to omeprazole after a single oral dose (40 mg), as a result of moderate inhibition of CYP2C19 activity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Interactions with CNS Active Drugs Concomitant administration of NUVIGIL with quetiapine reduced the systemic exposure of quetiapine.Data specific to NUVIGIL drug-drug interaction potential with other CNS active drugs are not available.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant administration of modafinil with methylphenidate or dextroamphetamine produced no significant alterations on the pharmacokinetic profile of modafinil or either stimulant, even though the absorption of modafinil was delayed for approximately one hour.Concomitant modafinil or clomipramine did not alter the pharmacokinetic profile of either drug; however, one incident of increased levels of clomipramine and its active metabolite desmethylclomipramine was reported in a patient with narcolepsy during treatment with modafinil.Data specific to NUVIGIL or modafinil drug-drug interaction potential with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors are not available.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Barbiturates can induce hepatic microsomal enzymes, resulting in increased metabolism and decreased anticoagulant response of oral anticoagulants (eg, warfarin, acenocoumarol, dicumarol, and phenprocoumon).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Corticosteroids Barbiturates appear to enhance the metabolism of exogenous corticosteroids, probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Griseofulvin Phenobarbital appears to interfere with the absorption of orally administered griseofulvin, thus decreasing its blood level.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effect of the resultant decreased blood levels of griseofulvin on therapeutic response has not been established.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Doxycycline Phenobarbital has been shown to shorten the half-life of doxycycline for as long as 2 weeks after barbiturate therapy is discontinued.This mechanism is probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes that metabolize the antibiotic.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Sodium valproate and valproic acid increase the secobarbital sodium serum levels; therefore, secobarbital sodium blood levels should be monitored closely and appropriate dosage adjustments made as clinically indicated.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Estradiol, Estrone, Progesterone, and Other Steroidal Hormones Pretreatment with or concurrent administration of phenobarbital may decrease the effect of estradiol by increasing its metabolism.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hepatic enzyme-inducing drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone, rifampin) can increase valproate clearance, while enzyme inhibitors (e.g., felbamate) can decrease valproate clearance.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For example, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital (or primidone) can double the clearance of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thus, patients on monotherapy will generally have longer half-lives and higher concentrations than patients receiving polytherapy with antiepilepsy drugs.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drugs for which a potentially important interaction has been observed Aspirin A study involving the co-administration of aspirin at antipyretic doses (11 to 16 mg/kg) with valproate to pediatric patients (n = 6) revealed a decrease in protein binding and an inhibition of metabolism of valproate.

5	The <U+03B2>-oxidation pathway consisting of 2-E-valproic acid, 3-OH-valproic acid, and 3-keto valproic acid was decreased from 25% of total metabolites excreted on valproate alone to 8.3% in the presence of aspirin.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Increasing the felbamate dose to 2,400 mg/day increased the mean valproate peak concentration to 133 mcg/mL (another 16% increase).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A decrease in valproate dosage may be necessary when felbamate therapy is initiated.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rifampin A study involving the administration of a single dose of valproate (7 mg/kg) 36 hours after 5 nights of daily dosing with rifampin (600 mg) revealed a 40% increase in the oral clearance of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rare postmarketing reports of concurrent use of valproate and amitriptyline resulting in an increased amitriptyline level have been received.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Consideration should be given to lowering the dose of amitriptyline/nortriptyline in the presence of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Carbamazepine/carbamazepine-10,11-Epoxide Serum levels of carbamazepine (CBZ) decreased 17% while that of carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide (CBZ-E) increased by 45% upon co-administration of valproate and CBZ to epileptic patients.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Administration of a single ethosuximide dose of 500 mg with valproate (800 to 1,600 mg/day) to healthy volunteers (n = 6) was accompanied by a 25% increase in elimination half-life of ethosuximide and a 15% decrease in its total clearance as compared to ethosuximide alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lamotrigine In a steady-state study involving 10 healthy volunteers, the elimination half-life of lamotrigine increased from 26 to 70 hours with valproate co-administration (a 165% increase).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The dose of lamotrigine should be reduced when co-administered with valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Phenobarbital Valproate was found to inhibit the metabolism of phenobarbital.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Co-administration of valproate (250 mg BID for 14 days) with phenobarbital to normal subjects (n = 6) resulted in a 50% increase in half-life and a 30% decrease in plasma clearance of phenobarbital (60 mg single-dose).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The fraction of phenobarbital dose excreted unchanged increased by 50% in presence of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Serum barbiturate concentrations should be obtained, if possible, and the barbiturate dosage decreased, if appropriate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Both the clearance and apparent volume of distribution of free phenytoin were reduced by 25%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Propofol The concomitant use of valproate and propofol may lead to increased blood levels of propofol.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Reduce the dose of propofol when co-administering with valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rufinamide Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, rufinamide clearance was decreased by valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rufinamide concentrations were increased by <16% to 70%, dependent on concentration of valproate (with the larger increases being seen in pediatric patients at high doses or concentrations of valproate).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients stabilized on rufinamide before being prescribed valproate should begin valproate therapy at a low dose, and titrate to a clinically effective dose.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Similarly, patients on valproate should begin at a rufinamide dose lower than 10 mg/kg per day (pediatric patients) or 400 mg per day (adults).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Tolbutamide From in vitro experiments, the unbound fraction of tolbutamide was increased from 20% to 50% when added to plasma samples taken from patients treated with valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Zidovudine In six patients who were seropositive for HIV, the clearance of zidovudine (100 mg q8h) was decreased by 38% after administration of valproate (250 or 500 mg q8h); the half-life of zidovudine was unaffected.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lorazepam Concomitant administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and lorazepam (1 mg BID) in normal male volunteers (n = 9) was accompanied by a 17% decrease in the plasma clearance of lorazepam.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Co-administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and olanzapine (5 mg) to healthy adults (n=10) caused 15% reduction in Cmax and 35% reduction in AUC of olanzapine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Protein binding of valproate is reduced in the elderly, in patients with chronic hepatic diseases, in patients with renal impairment, and in the presence of other drugs (e.g., aspirin).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Conversely, valproate may displace certain protein-bound drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, warfarin, and tolbutamide).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For example, patients taking enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital) will clear valproate more rapidly.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dexamethasone: Steady-state trough concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide were about 56% higher when dexamethasone was coadministered with each dose of albendazole.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Praziquantel: In the fed state increased mean maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve of albendazole sulfoxide by about 50% in healthy subjects.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cimetidine: Increased albendazole sulfoxide concentrations in bile and cystic fluid by about 2-fold in hydatid cyst patients.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Steady-state trough concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide were about 56% higher when 8 mg dexamethasone was co-administered with each dose of albendazole (15 mg/kg/day) in 8 neurocysticercosis patients.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In the fed state, praziquantel (40 mg/kg) increased mean maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve of albendazole sulfoxide by about 50% in healthy subjects (n = 10) compared with a separate group of subjects (n = 6) given albendazole alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Albendazole sulfoxide concentrations in bile and cystic fluid were increased (about 2-fold) in hydatid cyst patients treated with cimetidine (10 mg/kg/day) (n = 7) compared with albendazole (20 mg/kg/day) alone (n = 12).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Oral bioavailability appears to be enhanced when albendazole is coadministered with a fatty meal (estimated fat content 40 grams) as evidenced by higher (up to 5-fold on average) plasma concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide as compared to the fasted state.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, CONTRAVE should not be taken with a high-fat meal because of a resulting significant increase in bupropion and naltrexone systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During concomitant use with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel), the maximum recommended daily dose of CONTRAVE is two tablets (one tablet each morning and evening).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6: Bupropion inhibits CYP2D6 and can increase concentrations of: antidepressants, (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and many tricyclics), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide): Consider dose reduction when using with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant Treatment with CYP2B6 Inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel) can increase bupropion exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Do not exceed one tablet twice daily when taken with CYP2B6 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Studies in animals demonstrate that the acute toxicity of bupropion is enhanced by the MAOI phenelzine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CONTRAVE increased metoprolol AUC and Cmax by approximately 4- and 2-fold, respectively, relative to metoprolol alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Similar clinical drug interactions resulting in increased pharmacokinetic exposure of CYP2D6 substrates have also been observed with bupropion as a single agent with desipramine or venlafaxine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Coadministration of CONTRAVE with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isozyme including certain antidepressants (SSRIs and many tricyclics), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If CONTRAVE is added to the treatment regimen of a patient already receiving a drug metabolized by CYP2D6, the need to decrease the dose of the original medication should be considered, particularly for those concomitant medications with a narrow therapeutic index.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Inhibitors of CYP2B6: Ticlopidine and Clopidogrel: Concomitant treatment with these drugs can increase bupropion exposure but decrease hydroxybupropion exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During concomitant use with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel), the CONTRAVE daily dose should not exceed two tablets (one tablet each morning and evening).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The systemic concentrations of substrate drugs transported by OCT2 (such as amantadine, amiloride, cimetidine, dopamine, famotidine, memantine, metformin, pindolol, procainamide, ranitidine, varenicline, oxaliplatin) are likely to increase as a result of reduced renal clearance when coadministered with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food Effect on Absorption When CONTRAVE was administered with a high-fat meal, the AUC and Cmax for naltrexone increased 2.1-fold and 3.7-fold, respectively, and the AUC and Cmax for bupropion increased 1.4-fold and 1.8-fold, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	At steady state, the food effect increased AUC and Cmax for naltrexone by 1.7-fold and 1.9-fold, respectively, and increased AUC and Cmax for bupropion by 1.1-fold and 1.3-fold, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thus, CONTRAVE should not be taken with high-fat meals because of the resulting significant increases in bupropion and naltrexone systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In vitro studies suggest that paroxetine, sertraline, norfluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and nelfinavir inhibit the hydroxylation of bupropion.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The systemic concentrations of substrate drugs transported by OCT2 are likely to increase as a result of reduced renal clearance when coadministered with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	While not systematically studied, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or phenytoin may induce the metabolism of bupropion.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Chlorpheniramine may inhibit the hepatic metabolism of phenytoin, monitor phenytoin toxicity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The concurrent use of drugs that preferentially induce codeine N-demethylation (via CYP3A4) may increase the plasma concentrations of codeine<U+2019>s inactive metabolite norcodeine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drugs that inhibit codeine O-demethylation (via CYP2D6), may decrease the plasma concentration of codeine<U+2019>s active metabolites, morphine and morphine-6-glucuronide.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Adverse event reports in the literature suggest a possible drug interaction involving increased serum phenytoin levels and phenytoin toxicity when chlorpheniramine and phenytoin are co-administered.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The exact mechanism for this interaction is not known, however it is believed that chlorpheniramine may inhibit the hepatic metabolism of phenytoin.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There was a slight increase in the area under the curve (AUC, 11%) and mean peak drug concentration (Cmax, 18%) of digoxin with the coadministration of 100 mg sitagliptin for 10 days.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cimetidine: Acyclovir Cmax and AUC following a single dose of VALTREX (1 gram) increased by 8% and 32%, respectively, after a single dose of cimetidine (800 mg).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cimetidine Plus Probenecid: Acyclovir Cmax and AUC following a single dose of VALTREX (1 gram) increased by 30% and 78%, respectively, after a combination of cimetidine and probenecid, primarily due to a reduction in renal clearance of acyclovir.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Probenecid: Acyclovir Cmax and AUC following a single dose of VALTREX (1 gram) increased by 22% and 49%, respectively, after probenecid (1 gram).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Administration with rifampin or rifabutin is known to reduce atovaquone concentrations; concomitant use with MALARONE is not recommended.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant administration of rifampin or rifabutin is known to reduce atovaquone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant treatment with tetracycline has been associated with a reduction in plasma concentrations of atovaquone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	While antiemetics may be indicated for patients receiving MALARONE, metoclopramide may reduce the bioavailability of atovaquone and should be used only if other antiemetics are not available.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant administration of atovaquone and indinavir did not result in any change in the steady<U+2011>state AUC and Cmax of indinavir but resulted in a decrease in the Ctrough of indinavir.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Caution should be exercised when prescribing atovaquone with indinavir due to the decrease in trough concentrations of indinavir.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dietary fat taken with atovaquone increases the rate and extent of absorption, increasing AUC 2 to 3 times and Cmax 5 times over fasting.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rifampin/Rifabutin: Concomitant administration of rifampin or rifabutin is known to reduce atovaquone concentrations by approximately 50% and 34%, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Metoclopramide: Concomitant treatment with metoclopramide has been associated with decreased bioavailability of atovaquone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Indinavir: Concomitant administration of atovaquone (750 mg twice daily with food for 14 days) and indinavir (800 mg three times daily without food for 14 days) did not result in any change in the steady<U+2011>state AUC and Cmax of indinavir but resulted in a decrease in the Ctrough of indinavir (23% decrease [90% CI = 8%, 35%]).	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed in patients treated with DEXILANT.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Simultaneous administration of drugs that inhibit the activity of liver microsomal enzymes, i.e., CYP3A4 inhibitors such as cimetidine and ketoconazole, may prolong the half-life and decrease the plasma clearance of tinidazole, increasing the plasma concentrations of tinidazole.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Administration of Tindamax tablets with food resulted in a delay in T max of approximately 2 hours and a decline in Cmax of approximately 10%, compared to fasted conditions.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In clinical studies, the majority of patients required a decrease in daily levodopa dose if their daily dose of levodopa had been greater than or equal to 800 mg or if patients had moderate or severe dyskinesia before beginning treatment.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	To optimize an individual patient's response, reductions in daily levodopa dose or extending the interval between doses may be necessary.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In clinical studies, the average reduction in daily levodopa dose was about 25% in those patients requiring a levodopa dose reduction (more than 58% of patients with levodopa doses above 800 mg daily required such a reduction).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When entacapone is given in conjunction with levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, such as carbidopa, plasma levels of levodopa are greater and more sustained than after administration of levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is believed that at a given frequency of levodopa administration, these more sustained plasma levels of levodopa result in more constant dopaminergic stimulation in the brain, leading to greater effects on the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When 200 mg entacapone is administered together with levodopa and carbidopa, it increases the area under the curve (AUC) of levodopa by approximately 35%, and the elimination half-life of levodopa is prolonged from 1.3 hours to 2.4 hours.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When colesevelam is coadministered with glipizide ER, maximum plasma concentration and total exposure to glipizide is reduced.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The mean percentage increase in the GLUCOTROL AUC after fluconazole administration was 56.9% (range: 35 to 81).	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Lorazepam dosage needs to be reduced by approximately 50% when co-administered with probenecid.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effects of probenecid and valproate on lorazepam may be due to inhibition of glucuronidation.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In addition to appropriate levoleucovorin for injection therapy, continue hydration and urinary alkalinization, and monitoring of fluid and electrolyte status, until the serum methotrexate level has fallen to below 0.05 micromolar and the renal failure has resolved.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effect of leu co vorin products on fluorouracil : Leucovorin products increase the toxicity of fluorouracil.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Coadministration of ACTOS and gemfibrozil, a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, increases pioglitazone exposure approximately 3-fold.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of ACTOS is 15 mg daily when used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Strong CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g., gemfibrozil) increase pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CYP2C8 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may decrease pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Topiramate may decrease pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An inhibitor of CYP2C8 (e.g., gemfibrozil) significantly increases the exposure (area under the serum concentration-time curve or AUC) and half-life (t1/2) of pioglitazone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of ACTOS is 15 mg daily if used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An inducer of CYP2C8 (e.g., rifampin) may significantly decrease the exposure (AUC) of pioglitazone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A decrease in the exposure of pioglitazone and its active metabolites were noted with concomitant administration of pioglitazone and topiramate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food delays the Tmax to three to four hours but does not alter the extent of absorption (AUC).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In an in vitro study in human liver microsomes, inhibition of CYP2A6 hydroxylation of coumarin by fondaparinux (200 micromolar i.e., 350 mg/L) was 17 to 28%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effects of NUVIGIL on CYP3A4/5 Substrates The clearance of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A4/5 (e.g., steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, and triazolam) may be increased by NUVIGIL via induction of metabolic enzymes, which results in lower systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Blood levels of cyclosporine may be reduced when used with NUVIGIL.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effects of NUVIGIL on CYP2C19 Substrates Elimination of drugs that are substrates for CYP2C19 (e.g., phenytoin, diazepam, propranolol, omeprazole, and clomipramine) may be prolonged by NUVIGIL via inhibition of metabolic enzymes, with resultant higher systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cyclosporine: blood concentrations of cyclosporine may be reduced.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CYP2C19 substrates, such as omeprazole, phenytoin, and diazepam: exposure of these medications may be increased.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food effect on the overall bioavailability of NUVIGIL is considered minimal; however, time to reach peak concentration (tmax) may be delayed by approximately 2-4 hours in the fed state.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 250 mg resulted in a reduction in systemic exposure to midazolam by 32% after a single oral dose (5 mg) and 17% after a single intravenous dose (2 mg).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the blood levels and effectiveness of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A enzymes (e.g., steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, and triazolam) may be reduced after initiation of concomitant treatment with NUVIGIL.In a separate clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 250 mg with quetiapine (300 mg to 600 mg daily doses) resulted in a reduction in the mean systemic exposure of quetiapine by approximately 29%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 400 mg resulted in a 40% increase in exposure to omeprazole after a single oral dose (40 mg), as a result of moderate inhibition of CYP2C19 activity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Interactions with CNS Active Drugs Concomitant administration of NUVIGIL with quetiapine reduced the systemic exposure of quetiapine.Data specific to NUVIGIL drug-drug interaction potential with other CNS active drugs are not available.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant administration of modafinil with methylphenidate or dextroamphetamine produced no significant alterations on the pharmacokinetic profile of modafinil or either stimulant, even though the absorption of modafinil was delayed for approximately one hour.Concomitant modafinil or clomipramine did not alter the pharmacokinetic profile of either drug; however, one incident of increased levels of clomipramine and its active metabolite desmethylclomipramine was reported in a patient with narcolepsy during treatment with modafinil.Data specific to NUVIGIL or modafinil drug-drug interaction potential with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors are not available.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Barbiturates can induce hepatic microsomal enzymes, resulting in increased metabolism and decreased anticoagulant response of oral anticoagulants (eg, warfarin, acenocoumarol, dicumarol, and phenprocoumon).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Corticosteroids Barbiturates appear to enhance the metabolism of exogenous corticosteroids, probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Griseofulvin Phenobarbital appears to interfere with the absorption of orally administered griseofulvin, thus decreasing its blood level.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effect of the resultant decreased blood levels of griseofulvin on therapeutic response has not been established.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Doxycycline Phenobarbital has been shown to shorten the half-life of doxycycline for as long as 2 weeks after barbiturate therapy is discontinued.This mechanism is probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes that metabolize the antibiotic.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Sodium valproate and valproic acid increase the secobarbital sodium serum levels; therefore, secobarbital sodium blood levels should be monitored closely and appropriate dosage adjustments made as clinically indicated.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Estradiol, Estrone, Progesterone, and Other Steroidal Hormones Pretreatment with or concurrent administration of phenobarbital may decrease the effect of estradiol by increasing its metabolism.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hepatic enzyme-inducing drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone, rifampin) can increase valproate clearance, while enzyme inhibitors (e.g., felbamate) can decrease valproate clearance.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For example, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital (or primidone) can double the clearance of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thus, patients on monotherapy will generally have longer half-lives and higher concentrations than patients receiving polytherapy with antiepilepsy drugs.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Increasing the felbamate dose to 2,400 mg/day increased the mean valproate peak concentration to 133 mcg/mL (another 16% increase).	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Oral bioavailability appears to be enhanced when albendazole is coadministered with a fatty meal (estimated fat content 40 grams) as evidenced by higher (up to 5-fold on average) plasma concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide as compared to the fasted state.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, CONTRAVE should not be taken with a high-fat meal because of a resulting significant increase in bupropion and naltrexone systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During concomitant use with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel), the maximum recommended daily dose of CONTRAVE is two tablets (one tablet each morning and evening).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6: Bupropion inhibits CYP2D6 and can increase concentrations of: antidepressants, (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and many tricyclics), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide): Consider dose reduction when using with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant Treatment with CYP2B6 Inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel) can increase bupropion exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Do not exceed one tablet twice daily when taken with CYP2B6 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Studies in animals demonstrate that the acute toxicity of bupropion is enhanced by the MAOI phenelzine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CONTRAVE increased metoprolol AUC and Cmax by approximately 4- and 2-fold, respectively, relative to metoprolol alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Similar clinical drug interactions resulting in increased pharmacokinetic exposure of CYP2D6 substrates have also been observed with bupropion as a single agent with desipramine or venlafaxine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Coadministration of CONTRAVE with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isozyme including certain antidepressants (SSRIs and many tricyclics), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If CONTRAVE is added to the treatment regimen of a patient already receiving a drug metabolized by CYP2D6, the need to decrease the dose of the original medication should be considered, particularly for those concomitant medications with a narrow therapeutic index.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Inhibitors of CYP2B6: Ticlopidine and Clopidogrel: Concomitant treatment with these drugs can increase bupropion exposure but decrease hydroxybupropion exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During concomitant use with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel), the CONTRAVE daily dose should not exceed two tablets (one tablet each morning and evening).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The systemic concentrations of substrate drugs transported by OCT2 (such as amantadine, amiloride, cimetidine, dopamine, famotidine, memantine, metformin, pindolol, procainamide, ranitidine, varenicline, oxaliplatin) are likely to increase as a result of reduced renal clearance when coadministered with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food Effect on Absorption When CONTRAVE was administered with a high-fat meal, the AUC and Cmax for naltrexone increased 2.1-fold and 3.7-fold, respectively, and the AUC and Cmax for bupropion increased 1.4-fold and 1.8-fold, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	At steady state, the food effect increased AUC and Cmax for naltrexone by 1.7-fold and 1.9-fold, respectively, and increased AUC and Cmax for bupropion by 1.1-fold and 1.3-fold, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thus, CONTRAVE should not be taken with high-fat meals because of the resulting significant increases in bupropion and naltrexone systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In vitro studies suggest that paroxetine, sertraline, norfluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and nelfinavir inhibit the hydroxylation of bupropion.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The systemic concentrations of substrate drugs transported by OCT2 are likely to increase as a result of reduced renal clearance when coadministered with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	While not systematically studied, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or phenytoin may induce the metabolism of bupropion.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Chlorpheniramine may inhibit the hepatic metabolism of phenytoin, monitor phenytoin toxicity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Methotrexate Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose) may elevate and prolong serum concentrations of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Digoxin Clinical Impact: Potential for increased exposure of digoxin.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drugs Dependent on Gastric pH for Absorption (e.g., iron salts, erlotinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, mycophenolate mofetil, ketoconazole/itraconazole) Clinical Impact: Dexlansoprazole can reduce the absorption of other drugs due to its effect on reducing intragastric acidity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Intervention: Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF): Co-administration of PPIs in healthy subjects and in transplant patients receiving MMF has been reported to reduce the exposure to the active metabolite, mycophenolic acid (MPA), possibly due to a decrease in MMF solubility at an increased gastric pH.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The clinical relevance of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving DEXILANT and MMF.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Tacrolimus Clinical Impact: Potentially increased exposure of tacrolimus, especially in transplant patients who are intermediate or poor metabolizers of CYP2C19.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12) Deficiency: Daily long-term use (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption or a deficiency of cyanocobalamin.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Interaction with Methotrexate: Concomitant use with PPIs may elevate and/or prolong serum concentrations of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to toxicity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than three years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed in patients treated with DEXILANT.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effect on Food In food-effect studies in healthy subjects receiving DEXILANT under various fed conditions compared to fasting, increases in Cmax ranged from 12 to 55%, increases in AUC ranged from 9 to 37%, and Tmax varied (ranging from a decrease of 0.7 hours to an increase of three hours).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The mean AUC of the active metabolite of clopidogrel was reduced by approximately 9% (mean AUC ratio was 91%, with 90% CI of 86 to 97%) when DEXILANT was co-administered compared to administration of clopidogrel alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lithium generally should not be given with diuretics because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A number of drugs, including ethacrynic acid, have been shown to displace warfarin from plasma protein; a reduction in the usual anticoagulant dosage may be required in patients receiving both drugs.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lithium: Metronidazole has been reported to elevate serum lithium levels.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Phenytoin, Fosphenytoin: Concomitant administration of oral metronidazole and intravenous phenytoin was reported to result in prolongation of the half-life and reduction in the clearance of phenytoin.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cyclosporine, Tacrolimus: There are several case reports suggesting that metronidazole has the potential to increase the levels of cyclosporine and tacrolimus.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CYP3A4 Inducers and Inhibitors: Simultaneous administration of tinidazole with drugs that induce liver microsomal enzymes, i.e., CYP3A4 inducers such as phenobarbital, rifampin, phenytoin, and fosphenytoin (a pro-drug of phenytoin), may accelerate the elimination of tinidazole, decreasing the plasma level of tinidazole.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Simultaneous administration of drugs that inhibit the activity of liver microsomal enzymes, i.e., CYP3A4 inhibitors such as cimetidine and ketoconazole, may prolong the half-life and decrease the plasma clearance of tinidazole, increasing the plasma concentrations of tinidazole.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cholestyramine: Cholestyramine was shown to decrease the oral bioavailability of metronidazole by 21%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Administration of Tindamax tablets with food resulted in a delay in T max of approximately 2 hours and a decline in Cmax of approximately 10%, compared to fasted conditions.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In clinical studies, the majority of patients required a decrease in daily levodopa dose if their daily dose of levodopa had been greater than or equal to 800 mg or if patients had moderate or severe dyskinesia before beginning treatment.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	To optimize an individual patient's response, reductions in daily levodopa dose or extending the interval between doses may be necessary.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In clinical studies, the average reduction in daily levodopa dose was about 25% in those patients requiring a levodopa dose reduction (more than 58% of patients with levodopa doses above 800 mg daily required such a reduction).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When entacapone is given in conjunction with levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, such as carbidopa, plasma levels of levodopa are greater and more sustained than after administration of levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is believed that at a given frequency of levodopa administration, these more sustained plasma levels of levodopa result in more constant dopaminergic stimulation in the brain, leading to greater effects on the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When 200 mg entacapone is administered together with levodopa and carbidopa, it increases the area under the curve (AUC) of levodopa by approximately 35%, and the elimination half-life of levodopa is prolonged from 1.3 hours to 2.4 hours.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When colesevelam is coadministered with glipizide ER, maximum plasma concentration and total exposure to glipizide is reduced.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The mean percentage increase in the GLUCOTROL AUC after fluconazole administration was 56.9% (range: 35 to 81).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In studies assessing the effect of colesevelam on the pharmacokinetics of glipizide ER in healthy volunteers, reductions in glipizide AUC0<U+2013><U+221E> and Cmax of 12% and 13%, respectively were observed when colesevelam was coadministered with glipizide ER.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, GLUCOTROL should be administered at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam to ensure that colesevelam does not reduce the absorption of glipizide.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Total absorption and disposition of an oral dose was unaffected by food in normal volunteers, but absorption was delayed by about 40 minutes.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concurrent administration of lorazepam with valproate results in increased plasma concentrations and reduced clearance of lorazepam.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lorazepam dosage should be reduced to approximately 50% when co-administered with valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concurrent administration of lorazepam with probenecid may result in a more rapid onset or prolonged effect of lorazepam due to increased half-life and decreased total clearance.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lorazepam dosage needs to be reduced by approximately 50% when co-administered with probenecid.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effects of probenecid and valproate on lorazepam may be due to inhibition of glucuronidation.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Continue until methotrexate level is below 5 x 10-8 M (0.05 micromolar).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Continue Levoleucovorin for injection administration, hydration, and urinary alkalinization (pH 7.0 or greater) until the methotrexate level is below 5 x 10-8 M (0.05 micromolar).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Delayed late methotrexate elimination Serum methotrexate level remaining above 0.2 micromolar at 72 hours, and more than 0.05 micromolar at 96 hours after administration.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Continue 7.5 mg by intravenous infusion every 6 hours, until methotrexate level is less than 0.05 micromolar.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Delayed early methotrexate elimination and/or evidence of acute renal injury* Serum methotrexate level of 50 micromolar or more at 24 hours, or 5 micromolar or more at 48 hours after administration, OR 100% or greater increase in serum creatinine level at 24 hours after methotrexate administration (e.g., an increase from 0.5 mg/dL to a level of 1 mg/dL or more).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In addition to appropriate levoleucovorin for injection therapy, continue hydration and urinary alkalinization, and monitoring of fluid and electrolyte status, until the serum methotrexate level has fallen to below 0.05 micromolar and the renal failure has resolved.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effect of leu co vorin products on fluorouracil : Leucovorin products increase the toxicity of fluorouracil.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Leucovorin products increase the toxicities of fluorouracil.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Coadministration of ACTOS and gemfibrozil, a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, increases pioglitazone exposure approximately 3-fold.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of ACTOS is 15 mg daily when used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Strong CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g., gemfibrozil) increase pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CYP2C8 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may decrease pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Topiramate may decrease pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An inhibitor of CYP2C8 (e.g., gemfibrozil) significantly increases the exposure (area under the serum concentration-time curve or AUC) and half-life (t1/2) of pioglitazone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of ACTOS is 15 mg daily if used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An inducer of CYP2C8 (e.g., rifampin) may significantly decrease the exposure (AUC) of pioglitazone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A decrease in the exposure of pioglitazone and its active metabolites were noted with concomitant administration of pioglitazone and topiramate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food delays the Tmax to three to four hours but does not alter the extent of absorption (AUC).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In an in vitro study in human liver microsomes, inhibition of CYP2A6 hydroxylation of coumarin by fondaparinux (200 micromolar i.e., 350 mg/L) was 17 to 28%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effects of NUVIGIL on CYP3A4/5 Substrates The clearance of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A4/5 (e.g., steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, and triazolam) may be increased by NUVIGIL via induction of metabolic enzymes, which results in lower systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Blood levels of cyclosporine may be reduced when used with NUVIGIL.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effects of NUVIGIL on CYP2C19 Substrates Elimination of drugs that are substrates for CYP2C19 (e.g., phenytoin, diazepam, propranolol, omeprazole, and clomipramine) may be prolonged by NUVIGIL via inhibition of metabolic enzymes, with resultant higher systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cyclosporine: blood concentrations of cyclosporine may be reduced.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CYP2C19 substrates, such as omeprazole, phenytoin, and diazepam: exposure of these medications may be increased.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food effect on the overall bioavailability of NUVIGIL is considered minimal; however, time to reach peak concentration (tmax) may be delayed by approximately 2-4 hours in the fed state.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 250 mg resulted in a reduction in systemic exposure to midazolam by 32% after a single oral dose (5 mg) and 17% after a single intravenous dose (2 mg).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the blood levels and effectiveness of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A enzymes (e.g., steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, and triazolam) may be reduced after initiation of concomitant treatment with NUVIGIL.In a separate clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 250 mg with quetiapine (300 mg to 600 mg daily doses) resulted in a reduction in the mean systemic exposure of quetiapine by approximately 29%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 400 mg resulted in a 40% increase in exposure to omeprazole after a single oral dose (40 mg), as a result of moderate inhibition of CYP2C19 activity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Interactions with CNS Active Drugs Concomitant administration of NUVIGIL with quetiapine reduced the systemic exposure of quetiapine.Data specific to NUVIGIL drug-drug interaction potential with other CNS active drugs are not available.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant administration of modafinil with methylphenidate or dextroamphetamine produced no significant alterations on the pharmacokinetic profile of modafinil or either stimulant, even though the absorption of modafinil was delayed for approximately one hour.Concomitant modafinil or clomipramine did not alter the pharmacokinetic profile of either drug; however, one incident of increased levels of clomipramine and its active metabolite desmethylclomipramine was reported in a patient with narcolepsy during treatment with modafinil.Data specific to NUVIGIL or modafinil drug-drug interaction potential with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors are not available.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Barbiturates can induce hepatic microsomal enzymes, resulting in increased metabolism and decreased anticoagulant response of oral anticoagulants (eg, warfarin, acenocoumarol, dicumarol, and phenprocoumon).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Corticosteroids Barbiturates appear to enhance the metabolism of exogenous corticosteroids, probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Griseofulvin Phenobarbital appears to interfere with the absorption of orally administered griseofulvin, thus decreasing its blood level.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effect of the resultant decreased blood levels of griseofulvin on therapeutic response has not been established.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Doxycycline Phenobarbital has been shown to shorten the half-life of doxycycline for as long as 2 weeks after barbiturate therapy is discontinued.This mechanism is probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes that metabolize the antibiotic.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Sodium valproate and valproic acid increase the secobarbital sodium serum levels; therefore, secobarbital sodium blood levels should be monitored closely and appropriate dosage adjustments made as clinically indicated.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Estradiol, Estrone, Progesterone, and Other Steroidal Hormones Pretreatment with or concurrent administration of phenobarbital may decrease the effect of estradiol by increasing its metabolism.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hepatic enzyme-inducing drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone, rifampin) can increase valproate clearance, while enzyme inhibitors (e.g., felbamate) can decrease valproate clearance.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For example, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital (or primidone) can double the clearance of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thus, patients on monotherapy will generally have longer half-lives and higher concentrations than patients receiving polytherapy with antiepilepsy drugs.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drugs for which a potentially important interaction has been observed Aspirin A study involving the co-administration of aspirin at antipyretic doses (11 to 16 mg/kg) with valproate to pediatric patients (n = 6) revealed a decrease in protein binding and an inhibition of metabolism of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Valproate free fraction was increased 4-fold in the presence of aspirin compared to valproate alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The <U+03B2>-oxidation pathway consisting of 2-E-valproic acid, 3-OH-valproic acid, and 3-keto valproic acid was decreased from 25% of total metabolites excreted on valproate alone to 8.3% in the presence of aspirin.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Increasing the felbamate dose to 2,400 mg/day increased the mean valproate peak concentration to 133 mcg/mL (another 16% increase).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A decrease in valproate dosage may be necessary when felbamate therapy is initiated.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rifampin A study involving the administration of a single dose of valproate (7 mg/kg) 36 hours after 5 nights of daily dosing with rifampin (600 mg) revealed a 40% increase in the oral clearance of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Chlorpromazine A study involving the administration of 100 to 300 mg/day of chlorpromazine to schizophrenic patients already receiving valproate (200 mg BID) revealed a 15% increase in trough plasma levels of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drugs for which a potentially important valproate interaction has been observed Amitriptyline/Nortriptyline Administration of a single oral 50 mg dose of amitriptyline to 15 normal volunteers (10 males and 5 females) who received valproate (500 mg BID) resulted in a 21% decrease in plasma clearance of amitriptyline and a 34% decrease in the net clearance of nortriptyline.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rare postmarketing reports of concurrent use of valproate and amitriptyline resulting in an increased amitriptyline level have been received.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Consideration should be given to lowering the dose of amitriptyline/nortriptyline in the presence of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Carbamazepine/carbamazepine-10,11-Epoxide Serum levels of carbamazepine (CBZ) decreased 17% while that of carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide (CBZ-E) increased by 45% upon co-administration of valproate and CBZ to epileptic patients.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Diazepam Valproate displaces diazepam from its plasma albumin binding sites and inhibits its metabolism.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Co-administration of valproate (1,500 mg daily) increased the free fraction of diazepam (10 mg) by 90% in healthy volunteers (n = 6).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Plasma clearance and volume of distribution for free diazepam were reduced by 25% and 20%, respectively, in the presence of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Ethosuximide Valproate inhibits the metabolism of ethosuximide.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Administration of a single ethosuximide dose of 500 mg with valproate (800 to 1,600 mg/day) to healthy volunteers (n = 6) was accompanied by a 25% increase in elimination half-life of ethosuximide and a 15% decrease in its total clearance as compared to ethosuximide alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lamotrigine In a steady-state study involving 10 healthy volunteers, the elimination half-life of lamotrigine increased from 26 to 70 hours with valproate co-administration (a 165% increase).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The dose of lamotrigine should be reduced when co-administered with valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Phenobarbital Valproate was found to inhibit the metabolism of phenobarbital.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Co-administration of valproate (250 mg BID for 14 days) with phenobarbital to normal subjects (n = 6) resulted in a 50% increase in half-life and a 30% decrease in plasma clearance of phenobarbital (60 mg single-dose).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The fraction of phenobarbital dose excreted unchanged increased by 50% in presence of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Serum barbiturate concentrations should be obtained, if possible, and the barbiturate dosage decreased, if appropriate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Phenytoin Valproate displaces phenytoin from its plasma albumin binding sites and inhibits its hepatic metabolism.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Co-administration of valproate (400 mg TID) with phenytoin (250 mg) in normal volunteers (n = 7) was associated with a 60% increase in the free fraction of phenytoin.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Total plasma clearance and apparent volume of distribution of phenytoin increased 30% in the presence of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Both the clearance and apparent volume of distribution of free phenytoin were reduced by 25%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Propofol The concomitant use of valproate and propofol may lead to increased blood levels of propofol.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Reduce the dose of propofol when co-administering with valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rufinamide Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, rufinamide clearance was decreased by valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rufinamide concentrations were increased by <16% to 70%, dependent on concentration of valproate (with the larger increases being seen in pediatric patients at high doses or concentrations of valproate).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients stabilized on rufinamide before being prescribed valproate should begin valproate therapy at a low dose, and titrate to a clinically effective dose.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Similarly, patients on valproate should begin at a rufinamide dose lower than 10 mg/kg per day (pediatric patients) or 400 mg per day (adults).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Tolbutamide From in vitro experiments, the unbound fraction of tolbutamide was increased from 20% to 50% when added to plasma samples taken from patients treated with valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Warfarin In an in vitro study, valproate increased the unbound fraction of warfarin by up to 32.6%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Zidovudine In six patients who were seropositive for HIV, the clearance of zidovudine (100 mg q8h) was decreased by 38% after administration of valproate (250 or 500 mg q8h); the half-life of zidovudine was unaffected.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lorazepam Concomitant administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and lorazepam (1 mg BID) in normal male volunteers (n = 9) was accompanied by a 17% decrease in the plasma clearance of lorazepam.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Co-administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and olanzapine (5 mg) to healthy adults (n=10) caused 15% reduction in Cmax and 35% reduction in AUC of olanzapine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Protein binding of valproate is reduced in the elderly, in patients with chronic hepatic diseases, in patients with renal impairment, and in the presence of other drugs (e.g., aspirin).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Conversely, valproate may displace certain protein-bound drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, warfarin, and tolbutamide).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For example, patients taking enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital) will clear valproate more rapidly.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dexamethasone: Steady-state trough concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide were about 56% higher when dexamethasone was coadministered with each dose of albendazole.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Praziquantel: In the fed state increased mean maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve of albendazole sulfoxide by about 50% in healthy subjects.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cimetidine: Increased albendazole sulfoxide concentrations in bile and cystic fluid by about 2-fold in hydatid cyst patients.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Steady-state trough concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide were about 56% higher when 8 mg dexamethasone was co-administered with each dose of albendazole (15 mg/kg/day) in 8 neurocysticercosis patients.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In the fed state, praziquantel (40 mg/kg) increased mean maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve of albendazole sulfoxide by about 50% in healthy subjects (n = 10) compared with a separate group of subjects (n = 6) given albendazole alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Albendazole sulfoxide concentrations in bile and cystic fluid were increased (about 2-fold) in hydatid cyst patients treated with cimetidine (10 mg/kg/day) (n = 7) compared with albendazole (20 mg/kg/day) alone (n = 12).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Oral bioavailability appears to be enhanced when albendazole is coadministered with a fatty meal (estimated fat content 40 grams) as evidenced by higher (up to 5-fold on average) plasma concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide as compared to the fasted state.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, CONTRAVE should not be taken with a high-fat meal because of a resulting significant increase in bupropion and naltrexone systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During concomitant use with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel), the maximum recommended daily dose of CONTRAVE is two tablets (one tablet each morning and evening).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6: Bupropion inhibits CYP2D6 and can increase concentrations of: antidepressants, (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and many tricyclics), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide): Consider dose reduction when using with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant Treatment with CYP2B6 Inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel) can increase bupropion exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Do not exceed one tablet twice daily when taken with CYP2B6 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Studies in animals demonstrate that the acute toxicity of bupropion is enhanced by the MAOI phenelzine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CONTRAVE increased metoprolol AUC and Cmax by approximately 4- and 2-fold, respectively, relative to metoprolol alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Similar clinical drug interactions resulting in increased pharmacokinetic exposure of CYP2D6 substrates have also been observed with bupropion as a single agent with desipramine or venlafaxine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Coadministration of CONTRAVE with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isozyme including certain antidepressants (SSRIs and many tricyclics), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If CONTRAVE is added to the treatment regimen of a patient already receiving a drug metabolized by CYP2D6, the need to decrease the dose of the original medication should be considered, particularly for those concomitant medications with a narrow therapeutic index.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Inhibitors of CYP2B6: Ticlopidine and Clopidogrel: Concomitant treatment with these drugs can increase bupropion exposure but decrease hydroxybupropion exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During concomitant use with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel), the CONTRAVE daily dose should not exceed two tablets (one tablet each morning and evening).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The systemic concentrations of substrate drugs transported by OCT2 (such as amantadine, amiloride, cimetidine, dopamine, famotidine, memantine, metformin, pindolol, procainamide, ranitidine, varenicline, oxaliplatin) are likely to increase as a result of reduced renal clearance when coadministered with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food Effect on Absorption When CONTRAVE was administered with a high-fat meal, the AUC and Cmax for naltrexone increased 2.1-fold and 3.7-fold, respectively, and the AUC and Cmax for bupropion increased 1.4-fold and 1.8-fold, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	At steady state, the food effect increased AUC and Cmax for naltrexone by 1.7-fold and 1.9-fold, respectively, and increased AUC and Cmax for bupropion by 1.1-fold and 1.3-fold, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thus, CONTRAVE should not be taken with high-fat meals because of the resulting significant increases in bupropion and naltrexone systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In vitro studies suggest that paroxetine, sertraline, norfluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and nelfinavir inhibit the hydroxylation of bupropion.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The systemic concentrations of substrate drugs transported by OCT2 are likely to increase as a result of reduced renal clearance when coadministered with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	While not systematically studied, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or phenytoin may induce the metabolism of bupropion.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Chlorpheniramine may inhibit the hepatic metabolism of phenytoin, monitor phenytoin toxicity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The concurrent use of drugs that preferentially induce codeine N-demethylation (via CYP3A4) may increase the plasma concentrations of codeine<U+2019>s inactive metabolite norcodeine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drugs that inhibit codeine O-demethylation (via CYP2D6), may decrease the plasma concentration of codeine<U+2019>s active metabolites, morphine and morphine-6-glucuronide.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Adverse event reports in the literature suggest a possible drug interaction involving increased serum phenytoin levels and phenytoin toxicity when chlorpheniramine and phenytoin are co-administered.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The exact mechanism for this interaction is not known, however it is believed that chlorpheniramine may inhibit the hepatic metabolism of phenytoin.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There was a slight increase in the area under the curve (AUC, 11%) and mean peak drug concentration (Cmax, 18%) of digoxin with the coadministration of 100 mg sitagliptin for 10 days.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cimetidine: Acyclovir Cmax and AUC following a single dose of VALTREX (1 gram) increased by 8% and 32%, respectively, after a single dose of cimetidine (800 mg).	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	In clinical studies, the majority of patients required a decrease in daily levodopa dose if their daily dose of levodopa had been greater than or equal to 800 mg or if patients had moderate or severe dyskinesia before beginning treatment.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	To optimize an individual patient's response, reductions in daily levodopa dose or extending the interval between doses may be necessary.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In clinical studies, the average reduction in daily levodopa dose was about 25% in those patients requiring a levodopa dose reduction (more than 58% of patients with levodopa doses above 800 mg daily required such a reduction).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When entacapone is given in conjunction with levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, such as carbidopa, plasma levels of levodopa are greater and more sustained than after administration of levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is believed that at a given frequency of levodopa administration, these more sustained plasma levels of levodopa result in more constant dopaminergic stimulation in the brain, leading to greater effects on the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When 200 mg entacapone is administered together with levodopa and carbidopa, it increases the area under the curve (AUC) of levodopa by approximately 35%, and the elimination half-life of levodopa is prolonged from 1.3 hours to 2.4 hours.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Lorazepam dosage needs to be reduced by approximately 50% when co-administered with probenecid.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effects of probenecid and valproate on lorazepam may be due to inhibition of glucuronidation.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In addition to appropriate levoleucovorin for injection therapy, continue hydration and urinary alkalinization, and monitoring of fluid and electrolyte status, until the serum methotrexate level has fallen to below 0.05 micromolar and the renal failure has resolved.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Coadministration of ACTOS and gemfibrozil, a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, increases pioglitazone exposure approximately 3-fold.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of ACTOS is 15 mg daily when used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Strong CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g., gemfibrozil) increase pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CYP2C8 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may decrease pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Topiramate may decrease pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An inhibitor of CYP2C8 (e.g., gemfibrozil) significantly increases the exposure (area under the serum concentration-time curve or AUC) and half-life (t1/2) of pioglitazone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of ACTOS is 15 mg daily if used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An inducer of CYP2C8 (e.g., rifampin) may significantly decrease the exposure (AUC) of pioglitazone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A decrease in the exposure of pioglitazone and its active metabolites were noted with concomitant administration of pioglitazone and topiramate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food delays the Tmax to three to four hours but does not alter the extent of absorption (AUC).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In an in vitro study in human liver microsomes, inhibition of CYP2A6 hydroxylation of coumarin by fondaparinux (200 micromolar i.e., 350 mg/L) was 17 to 28%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effects of NUVIGIL on CYP3A4/5 Substrates The clearance of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A4/5 (e.g., steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, and triazolam) may be increased by NUVIGIL via induction of metabolic enzymes, which results in lower systemic exposure.

5	Effects of NUVIGIL on CYP2C19 Substrates Elimination of drugs that are substrates for CYP2C19 (e.g., phenytoin, diazepam, propranolol, omeprazole, and clomipramine) may be prolonged by NUVIGIL via inhibition of metabolic enzymes, with resultant higher systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cyclosporine: blood concentrations of cyclosporine may be reduced.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CYP2C19 substrates, such as omeprazole, phenytoin, and diazepam: exposure of these medications may be increased.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food effect on the overall bioavailability of NUVIGIL is considered minimal; however, time to reach peak concentration (tmax) may be delayed by approximately 2-4 hours in the fed state.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 250 mg resulted in a reduction in systemic exposure to midazolam by 32% after a single oral dose (5 mg) and 17% after a single intravenous dose (2 mg).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the blood levels and effectiveness of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A enzymes (e.g., steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, and triazolam) may be reduced after initiation of concomitant treatment with NUVIGIL.In a separate clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 250 mg with quetiapine (300 mg to 600 mg daily doses) resulted in a reduction in the mean systemic exposure of quetiapine by approximately 29%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 400 mg resulted in a 40% increase in exposure to omeprazole after a single oral dose (40 mg), as a result of moderate inhibition of CYP2C19 activity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Interactions with CNS Active Drugs Concomitant administration of NUVIGIL with quetiapine reduced the systemic exposure of quetiapine.Data specific to NUVIGIL drug-drug interaction potential with other CNS active drugs are not available.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant administration of modafinil with methylphenidate or dextroamphetamine produced no significant alterations on the pharmacokinetic profile of modafinil or either stimulant, even though the absorption of modafinil was delayed for approximately one hour.Concomitant modafinil or clomipramine did not alter the pharmacokinetic profile of either drug; however, one incident of increased levels of clomipramine and its active metabolite desmethylclomipramine was reported in a patient with narcolepsy during treatment with modafinil.Data specific to NUVIGIL or modafinil drug-drug interaction potential with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors are not available.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Barbiturates can induce hepatic microsomal enzymes, resulting in increased metabolism and decreased anticoagulant response of oral anticoagulants (eg, warfarin, acenocoumarol, dicumarol, and phenprocoumon).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Corticosteroids Barbiturates appear to enhance the metabolism of exogenous corticosteroids, probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Griseofulvin Phenobarbital appears to interfere with the absorption of orally administered griseofulvin, thus decreasing its blood level.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effect of the resultant decreased blood levels of griseofulvin on therapeutic response has not been established.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Doxycycline Phenobarbital has been shown to shorten the half-life of doxycycline for as long as 2 weeks after barbiturate therapy is discontinued.This mechanism is probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes that metabolize the antibiotic.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Sodium valproate and valproic acid increase the secobarbital sodium serum levels; therefore, secobarbital sodium blood levels should be monitored closely and appropriate dosage adjustments made as clinically indicated.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Estradiol, Estrone, Progesterone, and Other Steroidal Hormones Pretreatment with or concurrent administration of phenobarbital may decrease the effect of estradiol by increasing its metabolism.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hepatic enzyme-inducing drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone, rifampin) can increase valproate clearance, while enzyme inhibitors (e.g., felbamate) can decrease valproate clearance.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For example, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital (or primidone) can double the clearance of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rare postmarketing reports of concurrent use of valproate and amitriptyline resulting in an increased amitriptyline level have been received.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Consideration should be given to lowering the dose of amitriptyline/nortriptyline in the presence of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lamotrigine In a steady-state study involving 10 healthy volunteers, the elimination half-life of lamotrigine increased from 26 to 70 hours with valproate co-administration (a 165% increase).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The dose of lamotrigine should be reduced when co-administered with valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Phenobarbital Valproate was found to inhibit the metabolism of phenobarbital.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Rufinamide Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, rufinamide clearance was decreased by valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rufinamide concentrations were increased by <16% to 70%, dependent on concentration of valproate (with the larger increases being seen in pediatric patients at high doses or concentrations of valproate).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients stabilized on rufinamide before being prescribed valproate should begin valproate therapy at a low dose, and titrate to a clinically effective dose.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Similarly, patients on valproate should begin at a rufinamide dose lower than 10 mg/kg per day (pediatric patients) or 400 mg per day (adults).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Tolbutamide From in vitro experiments, the unbound fraction of tolbutamide was increased from 20% to 50% when added to plasma samples taken from patients treated with valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Co-administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and olanzapine (5 mg) to healthy adults (n=10) caused 15% reduction in Cmax and 35% reduction in AUC of olanzapine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Protein binding of valproate is reduced in the elderly, in patients with chronic hepatic diseases, in patients with renal impairment, and in the presence of other drugs (e.g., aspirin).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Conversely, valproate may displace certain protein-bound drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, warfarin, and tolbutamide).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For example, patients taking enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital) will clear valproate more rapidly.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dexamethasone: Steady-state trough concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide were about 56% higher when dexamethasone was coadministered with each dose of albendazole.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Praziquantel: In the fed state increased mean maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve of albendazole sulfoxide by about 50% in healthy subjects.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	In the fed state, praziquantel (40 mg/kg) increased mean maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve of albendazole sulfoxide by about 50% in healthy subjects (n = 10) compared with a separate group of subjects (n = 6) given albendazole alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Albendazole sulfoxide concentrations in bile and cystic fluid were increased (about 2-fold) in hydatid cyst patients treated with cimetidine (10 mg/kg/day) (n = 7) compared with albendazole (20 mg/kg/day) alone (n = 12).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Oral bioavailability appears to be enhanced when albendazole is coadministered with a fatty meal (estimated fat content 40 grams) as evidenced by higher (up to 5-fold on average) plasma concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide as compared to the fasted state.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, CONTRAVE should not be taken with a high-fat meal because of a resulting significant increase in bupropion and naltrexone systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During concomitant use with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel), the maximum recommended daily dose of CONTRAVE is two tablets (one tablet each morning and evening).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6: Bupropion inhibits CYP2D6 and can increase concentrations of: antidepressants, (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and many tricyclics), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide): Consider dose reduction when using with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant Treatment with CYP2B6 Inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel) can increase bupropion exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Do not exceed one tablet twice daily when taken with CYP2B6 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Studies in animals demonstrate that the acute toxicity of bupropion is enhanced by the MAOI phenelzine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CONTRAVE increased metoprolol AUC and Cmax by approximately 4- and 2-fold, respectively, relative to metoprolol alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Similar clinical drug interactions resulting in increased pharmacokinetic exposure of CYP2D6 substrates have also been observed with bupropion as a single agent with desipramine or venlafaxine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Coadministration of CONTRAVE with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isozyme including certain antidepressants (SSRIs and many tricyclics), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If CONTRAVE is added to the treatment regimen of a patient already receiving a drug metabolized by CYP2D6, the need to decrease the dose of the original medication should be considered, particularly for those concomitant medications with a narrow therapeutic index.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Inhibitors of CYP2B6: Ticlopidine and Clopidogrel: Concomitant treatment with these drugs can increase bupropion exposure but decrease hydroxybupropion exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During concomitant use with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel), the CONTRAVE daily dose should not exceed two tablets (one tablet each morning and evening).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The systemic concentrations of substrate drugs transported by OCT2 (such as amantadine, amiloride, cimetidine, dopamine, famotidine, memantine, metformin, pindolol, procainamide, ranitidine, varenicline, oxaliplatin) are likely to increase as a result of reduced renal clearance when coadministered with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food Effect on Absorption When CONTRAVE was administered with a high-fat meal, the AUC and Cmax for naltrexone increased 2.1-fold and 3.7-fold, respectively, and the AUC and Cmax for bupropion increased 1.4-fold and 1.8-fold, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	At steady state, the food effect increased AUC and Cmax for naltrexone by 1.7-fold and 1.9-fold, respectively, and increased AUC and Cmax for bupropion by 1.1-fold and 1.3-fold, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thus, CONTRAVE should not be taken with high-fat meals because of the resulting significant increases in bupropion and naltrexone systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In vitro studies suggest that paroxetine, sertraline, norfluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and nelfinavir inhibit the hydroxylation of bupropion.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The systemic concentrations of substrate drugs transported by OCT2 are likely to increase as a result of reduced renal clearance when coadministered with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	While not systematically studied, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or phenytoin may induce the metabolism of bupropion.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Chlorpheniramine may inhibit the hepatic metabolism of phenytoin, monitor phenytoin toxicity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Cimetidine Plus Probenecid: Acyclovir Cmax and AUC following a single dose of VALTREX (1 gram) increased by 30% and 78%, respectively, after a combination of cimetidine and probenecid, primarily due to a reduction in renal clearance of acyclovir.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Probenecid: Acyclovir Cmax and AUC following a single dose of VALTREX (1 gram) increased by 22% and 49%, respectively, after probenecid (1 gram).	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Concomitant administration of rifampin or rifabutin is known to reduce atovaquone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant treatment with tetracycline has been associated with a reduction in plasma concentrations of atovaquone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Concomitant administration of atovaquone and indinavir did not result in any change in the steady<U+2011>state AUC and Cmax of indinavir but resulted in a decrease in the Ctrough of indinavir.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Caution should be exercised when prescribing atovaquone with indinavir due to the decrease in trough concentrations of indinavir.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dietary fat taken with atovaquone increases the rate and extent of absorption, increasing AUC 2 to 3 times and Cmax 5 times over fasting.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rifampin/Rifabutin: Concomitant administration of rifampin or rifabutin is known to reduce atovaquone concentrations by approximately 50% and 34%, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than three years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed in patients treated with DEXILANT.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Lithium generally should not be given with diuretics because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A number of drugs, including ethacrynic acid, have been shown to displace warfarin from plasma protein; a reduction in the usual anticoagulant dosage may be required in patients receiving both drugs.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lithium: Metronidazole has been reported to elevate serum lithium levels.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Simultaneous administration of drugs that inhibit the activity of liver microsomal enzymes, i.e., CYP3A4 inhibitors such as cimetidine and ketoconazole, may prolong the half-life and decrease the plasma clearance of tinidazole, increasing the plasma concentrations of tinidazole.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cholestyramine: Cholestyramine was shown to decrease the oral bioavailability of metronidazole by 21%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Administration of Tindamax tablets with food resulted in a delay in T max of approximately 2 hours and a decline in Cmax of approximately 10%, compared to fasted conditions.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In clinical studies, the majority of patients required a decrease in daily levodopa dose if their daily dose of levodopa had been greater than or equal to 800 mg or if patients had moderate or severe dyskinesia before beginning treatment.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	To optimize an individual patient's response, reductions in daily levodopa dose or extending the interval between doses may be necessary.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In clinical studies, the average reduction in daily levodopa dose was about 25% in those patients requiring a levodopa dose reduction (more than 58% of patients with levodopa doses above 800 mg daily required such a reduction).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When entacapone is given in conjunction with levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, such as carbidopa, plasma levels of levodopa are greater and more sustained than after administration of levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is believed that at a given frequency of levodopa administration, these more sustained plasma levels of levodopa result in more constant dopaminergic stimulation in the brain, leading to greater effects on the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When 200 mg entacapone is administered together with levodopa and carbidopa, it increases the area under the curve (AUC) of levodopa by approximately 35%, and the elimination half-life of levodopa is prolonged from 1.3 hours to 2.4 hours.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When colesevelam is coadministered with glipizide ER, maximum plasma concentration and total exposure to glipizide is reduced.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Lorazepam dosage needs to be reduced by approximately 50% when co-administered with probenecid.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effects of probenecid and valproate on lorazepam may be due to inhibition of glucuronidation.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In addition to appropriate levoleucovorin for injection therapy, continue hydration and urinary alkalinization, and monitoring of fluid and electrolyte status, until the serum methotrexate level has fallen to below 0.05 micromolar and the renal failure has resolved.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effect of leu co vorin products on fluorouracil : Leucovorin products increase the toxicity of fluorouracil.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Leucovorin products increase the toxicities of fluorouracil.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Coadministration of ACTOS and gemfibrozil, a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, increases pioglitazone exposure approximately 3-fold.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of ACTOS is 15 mg daily when used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Strong CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g., gemfibrozil) increase pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CYP2C8 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may decrease pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Topiramate may decrease pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An inhibitor of CYP2C8 (e.g., gemfibrozil) significantly increases the exposure (area under the serum concentration-time curve or AUC) and half-life (t1/2) of pioglitazone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of ACTOS is 15 mg daily if used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An inducer of CYP2C8 (e.g., rifampin) may significantly decrease the exposure (AUC) of pioglitazone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A decrease in the exposure of pioglitazone and its active metabolites were noted with concomitant administration of pioglitazone and topiramate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food delays the Tmax to three to four hours but does not alter the extent of absorption (AUC).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In an in vitro study in human liver microsomes, inhibition of CYP2A6 hydroxylation of coumarin by fondaparinux (200 micromolar i.e., 350 mg/L) was 17 to 28%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effects of NUVIGIL on CYP3A4/5 Substrates The clearance of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A4/5 (e.g., steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, and triazolam) may be increased by NUVIGIL via induction of metabolic enzymes, which results in lower systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Blood levels of cyclosporine may be reduced when used with NUVIGIL.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effects of NUVIGIL on CYP2C19 Substrates Elimination of drugs that are substrates for CYP2C19 (e.g., phenytoin, diazepam, propranolol, omeprazole, and clomipramine) may be prolonged by NUVIGIL via inhibition of metabolic enzymes, with resultant higher systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cyclosporine: blood concentrations of cyclosporine may be reduced.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CYP2C19 substrates, such as omeprazole, phenytoin, and diazepam: exposure of these medications may be increased.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food effect on the overall bioavailability of NUVIGIL is considered minimal; however, time to reach peak concentration (tmax) may be delayed by approximately 2-4 hours in the fed state.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 250 mg resulted in a reduction in systemic exposure to midazolam by 32% after a single oral dose (5 mg) and 17% after a single intravenous dose (2 mg).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the blood levels and effectiveness of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A enzymes (e.g., steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, and triazolam) may be reduced after initiation of concomitant treatment with NUVIGIL.In a separate clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 250 mg with quetiapine (300 mg to 600 mg daily doses) resulted in a reduction in the mean systemic exposure of quetiapine by approximately 29%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 400 mg resulted in a 40% increase in exposure to omeprazole after a single oral dose (40 mg), as a result of moderate inhibition of CYP2C19 activity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Interactions with CNS Active Drugs Concomitant administration of NUVIGIL with quetiapine reduced the systemic exposure of quetiapine.Data specific to NUVIGIL drug-drug interaction potential with other CNS active drugs are not available.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant administration of modafinil with methylphenidate or dextroamphetamine produced no significant alterations on the pharmacokinetic profile of modafinil or either stimulant, even though the absorption of modafinil was delayed for approximately one hour.Concomitant modafinil or clomipramine did not alter the pharmacokinetic profile of either drug; however, one incident of increased levels of clomipramine and its active metabolite desmethylclomipramine was reported in a patient with narcolepsy during treatment with modafinil.Data specific to NUVIGIL or modafinil drug-drug interaction potential with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors are not available.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Barbiturates can induce hepatic microsomal enzymes, resulting in increased metabolism and decreased anticoagulant response of oral anticoagulants (eg, warfarin, acenocoumarol, dicumarol, and phenprocoumon).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Corticosteroids Barbiturates appear to enhance the metabolism of exogenous corticosteroids, probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Griseofulvin Phenobarbital appears to interfere with the absorption of orally administered griseofulvin, thus decreasing its blood level.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effect of the resultant decreased blood levels of griseofulvin on therapeutic response has not been established.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Doxycycline Phenobarbital has been shown to shorten the half-life of doxycycline for as long as 2 weeks after barbiturate therapy is discontinued.This mechanism is probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes that metabolize the antibiotic.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Sodium valproate and valproic acid increase the secobarbital sodium serum levels; therefore, secobarbital sodium blood levels should be monitored closely and appropriate dosage adjustments made as clinically indicated.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Estradiol, Estrone, Progesterone, and Other Steroidal Hormones Pretreatment with or concurrent administration of phenobarbital may decrease the effect of estradiol by increasing its metabolism.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hepatic enzyme-inducing drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone, rifampin) can increase valproate clearance, while enzyme inhibitors (e.g., felbamate) can decrease valproate clearance.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For example, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital (or primidone) can double the clearance of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thus, patients on monotherapy will generally have longer half-lives and higher concentrations than patients receiving polytherapy with antiepilepsy drugs.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Increasing the felbamate dose to 2,400 mg/day increased the mean valproate peak concentration to 133 mcg/mL (another 16% increase).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A decrease in valproate dosage may be necessary when felbamate therapy is initiated.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rifampin A study involving the administration of a single dose of valproate (7 mg/kg) 36 hours after 5 nights of daily dosing with rifampin (600 mg) revealed a 40% increase in the oral clearance of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rare postmarketing reports of concurrent use of valproate and amitriptyline resulting in an increased amitriptyline level have been received.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Consideration should be given to lowering the dose of amitriptyline/nortriptyline in the presence of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Carbamazepine/carbamazepine-10,11-Epoxide Serum levels of carbamazepine (CBZ) decreased 17% while that of carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide (CBZ-E) increased by 45% upon co-administration of valproate and CBZ to epileptic patients.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Phenobarbital Valproate was found to inhibit the metabolism of phenobarbital.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Co-administration of valproate (250 mg BID for 14 days) with phenobarbital to normal subjects (n = 6) resulted in a 50% increase in half-life and a 30% decrease in plasma clearance of phenobarbital (60 mg single-dose).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The fraction of phenobarbital dose excreted unchanged increased by 50% in presence of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Serum barbiturate concentrations should be obtained, if possible, and the barbiturate dosage decreased, if appropriate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Rufinamide Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, rufinamide clearance was decreased by valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rufinamide concentrations were increased by <16% to 70%, dependent on concentration of valproate (with the larger increases being seen in pediatric patients at high doses or concentrations of valproate).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients stabilized on rufinamide before being prescribed valproate should begin valproate therapy at a low dose, and titrate to a clinically effective dose.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Similarly, patients on valproate should begin at a rufinamide dose lower than 10 mg/kg per day (pediatric patients) or 400 mg per day (adults).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Tolbutamide From in vitro experiments, the unbound fraction of tolbutamide was increased from 20% to 50% when added to plasma samples taken from patients treated with valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Zidovudine In six patients who were seropositive for HIV, the clearance of zidovudine (100 mg q8h) was decreased by 38% after administration of valproate (250 or 500 mg q8h); the half-life of zidovudine was unaffected.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lorazepam Concomitant administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and lorazepam (1 mg BID) in normal male volunteers (n = 9) was accompanied by a 17% decrease in the plasma clearance of lorazepam.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Co-administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and olanzapine (5 mg) to healthy adults (n=10) caused 15% reduction in Cmax and 35% reduction in AUC of olanzapine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Protein binding of valproate is reduced in the elderly, in patients with chronic hepatic diseases, in patients with renal impairment, and in the presence of other drugs (e.g., aspirin).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Conversely, valproate may displace certain protein-bound drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, warfarin, and tolbutamide).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For example, patients taking enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital) will clear valproate more rapidly.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Praziquantel: In the fed state increased mean maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve of albendazole sulfoxide by about 50% in healthy subjects.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cimetidine: Increased albendazole sulfoxide concentrations in bile and cystic fluid by about 2-fold in hydatid cyst patients.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Steady-state trough concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide were about 56% higher when 8 mg dexamethasone was co-administered with each dose of albendazole (15 mg/kg/day) in 8 neurocysticercosis patients.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In the fed state, praziquantel (40 mg/kg) increased mean maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve of albendazole sulfoxide by about 50% in healthy subjects (n = 10) compared with a separate group of subjects (n = 6) given albendazole alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Albendazole sulfoxide concentrations in bile and cystic fluid were increased (about 2-fold) in hydatid cyst patients treated with cimetidine (10 mg/kg/day) (n = 7) compared with albendazole (20 mg/kg/day) alone (n = 12).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Oral bioavailability appears to be enhanced when albendazole is coadministered with a fatty meal (estimated fat content 40 grams) as evidenced by higher (up to 5-fold on average) plasma concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide as compared to the fasted state.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, CONTRAVE should not be taken with a high-fat meal because of a resulting significant increase in bupropion and naltrexone systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During concomitant use with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel), the maximum recommended daily dose of CONTRAVE is two tablets (one tablet each morning and evening).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6: Bupropion inhibits CYP2D6 and can increase concentrations of: antidepressants, (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and many tricyclics), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide): Consider dose reduction when using with CONTRAVE.

5	Studies in animals demonstrate that the acute toxicity of bupropion is enhanced by the MAOI phenelzine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CONTRAVE increased metoprolol AUC and Cmax by approximately 4- and 2-fold, respectively, relative to metoprolol alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Similar clinical drug interactions resulting in increased pharmacokinetic exposure of CYP2D6 substrates have also been observed with bupropion as a single agent with desipramine or venlafaxine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Coadministration of CONTRAVE with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isozyme including certain antidepressants (SSRIs and many tricyclics), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If CONTRAVE is added to the treatment regimen of a patient already receiving a drug metabolized by CYP2D6, the need to decrease the dose of the original medication should be considered, particularly for those concomitant medications with a narrow therapeutic index.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	The systemic concentrations of substrate drugs transported by OCT2 (such as amantadine, amiloride, cimetidine, dopamine, famotidine, memantine, metformin, pindolol, procainamide, ranitidine, varenicline, oxaliplatin) are likely to increase as a result of reduced renal clearance when coadministered with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food Effect on Absorption When CONTRAVE was administered with a high-fat meal, the AUC and Cmax for naltrexone increased 2.1-fold and 3.7-fold, respectively, and the AUC and Cmax for bupropion increased 1.4-fold and 1.8-fold, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	In clinical studies, the majority of patients required a decrease in daily levodopa dose if their daily dose of levodopa had been greater than or equal to 800 mg or if patients had moderate or severe dyskinesia before beginning treatment.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	To optimize an individual patient's response, reductions in daily levodopa dose or extending the interval between doses may be necessary.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In clinical studies, the average reduction in daily levodopa dose was about 25% in those patients requiring a levodopa dose reduction (more than 58% of patients with levodopa doses above 800 mg daily required such a reduction).	Pharmacokinetic interaction

Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is believed that at a given frequency of levodopa administration, these more sustained plasma levels of levodopa result in more constant dopaminergic stimulation in the brain, leading to greater effects on the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When 200 mg entacapone is administered together with levodopa and carbidopa, it increases the area under the curve (AUC) of levodopa by approximately 35%, and the elimination half-life of levodopa is prolonged from 1.3 hours to 2.4 hours.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Lorazepam dosage needs to be reduced by approximately 50% when co-administered with probenecid.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effects of probenecid and valproate on lorazepam may be due to inhibition of glucuronidation.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	In a clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 250 mg resulted in a reduction in systemic exposure to midazolam by 32% after a single oral dose (5 mg) and 17% after a single intravenous dose (2 mg).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the blood levels and effectiveness of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A enzymes (e.g., steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, and triazolam) may be reduced after initiation of concomitant treatment with NUVIGIL.In a separate clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 250 mg with quetiapine (300 mg to 600 mg daily doses) resulted in a reduction in the mean systemic exposure of quetiapine by approximately 29%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 400 mg resulted in a 40% increase in exposure to omeprazole after a single oral dose (40 mg), as a result of moderate inhibition of CYP2C19 activity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Doxycycline Phenobarbital has been shown to shorten the half-life of doxycycline for as long as 2 weeks after barbiturate therapy is discontinued.This mechanism is probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes that metabolize the antibiotic.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Sodium valproate and valproic acid increase the secobarbital sodium serum levels; therefore, secobarbital sodium blood levels should be monitored closely and appropriate dosage adjustments made as clinically indicated.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Estradiol, Estrone, Progesterone, and Other Steroidal Hormones Pretreatment with or concurrent administration of phenobarbital may decrease the effect of estradiol by increasing its metabolism.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Albendazole sulfoxide concentrations in bile and cystic fluid were increased (about 2-fold) in hydatid cyst patients treated with cimetidine (10 mg/kg/day) (n = 7) compared with albendazole (20 mg/kg/day) alone (n = 12).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Oral bioavailability appears to be enhanced when albendazole is coadministered with a fatty meal (estimated fat content 40 grams) as evidenced by higher (up to 5-fold on average) plasma concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide as compared to the fasted state.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, CONTRAVE should not be taken with a high-fat meal because of a resulting significant increase in bupropion and naltrexone systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During concomitant use with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel), the maximum recommended daily dose of CONTRAVE is two tablets (one tablet each morning and evening).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6: Bupropion inhibits CYP2D6 and can increase concentrations of: antidepressants, (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and many tricyclics), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide): Consider dose reduction when using with CONTRAVE.

5	CONTRAVE increased metoprolol AUC and Cmax by approximately 4- and 2-fold, respectively, relative to metoprolol alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Similar clinical drug interactions resulting in increased pharmacokinetic exposure of CYP2D6 substrates have also been observed with bupropion as a single agent with desipramine or venlafaxine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Coadministration of CONTRAVE with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isozyme including certain antidepressants (SSRIs and many tricyclics), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If CONTRAVE is added to the treatment regimen of a patient already receiving a drug metabolized by CYP2D6, the need to decrease the dose of the original medication should be considered, particularly for those concomitant medications with a narrow therapeutic index.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Inhibitors of CYP2B6: Ticlopidine and Clopidogrel: Concomitant treatment with these drugs can increase bupropion exposure but decrease hydroxybupropion exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During concomitant use with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel), the CONTRAVE daily dose should not exceed two tablets (one tablet each morning and evening).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The systemic concentrations of substrate drugs transported by OCT2 (such as amantadine, amiloride, cimetidine, dopamine, famotidine, memantine, metformin, pindolol, procainamide, ranitidine, varenicline, oxaliplatin) are likely to increase as a result of reduced renal clearance when coadministered with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food Effect on Absorption When CONTRAVE was administered with a high-fat meal, the AUC and Cmax for naltrexone increased 2.1-fold and 3.7-fold, respectively, and the AUC and Cmax for bupropion increased 1.4-fold and 1.8-fold, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	At steady state, the food effect increased AUC and Cmax for naltrexone by 1.7-fold and 1.9-fold, respectively, and increased AUC and Cmax for bupropion by 1.1-fold and 1.3-fold, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thus, CONTRAVE should not be taken with high-fat meals because of the resulting significant increases in bupropion and naltrexone systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In vitro studies suggest that paroxetine, sertraline, norfluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and nelfinavir inhibit the hydroxylation of bupropion.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The systemic concentrations of substrate drugs transported by OCT2 are likely to increase as a result of reduced renal clearance when coadministered with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Drugs Dependent on Gastric pH for Absorption (e.g., iron salts, erlotinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, mycophenolate mofetil, ketoconazole/itraconazole) Clinical Impact: Dexlansoprazole can reduce the absorption of other drugs due to its effect on reducing intragastric acidity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Intervention: Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF): Co-administration of PPIs in healthy subjects and in transplant patients receiving MMF has been reported to reduce the exposure to the active metabolite, mycophenolic acid (MPA), possibly due to a decrease in MMF solubility at an increased gastric pH.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The clinical relevance of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving DEXILANT and MMF.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than three years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed in patients treated with DEXILANT.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effect on Food In food-effect studies in healthy subjects receiving DEXILANT under various fed conditions compared to fasting, increases in Cmax ranged from 12 to 55%, increases in AUC ranged from 9 to 37%, and Tmax varied (ranging from a decrease of 0.7 hours to an increase of three hours).

5	Lithium generally should not be given with diuretics because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A number of drugs, including ethacrynic acid, have been shown to displace warfarin from plasma protein; a reduction in the usual anticoagulant dosage may be required in patients receiving both drugs.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lithium: Metronidazole has been reported to elevate serum lithium levels.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Simultaneous administration of drugs that inhibit the activity of liver microsomal enzymes, i.e., CYP3A4 inhibitors such as cimetidine and ketoconazole, may prolong the half-life and decrease the plasma clearance of tinidazole, increasing the plasma concentrations of tinidazole.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cholestyramine: Cholestyramine was shown to decrease the oral bioavailability of metronidazole by 21%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Administration of Tindamax tablets with food resulted in a delay in T max of approximately 2 hours and a decline in Cmax of approximately 10%, compared to fasted conditions.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In clinical studies, the majority of patients required a decrease in daily levodopa dose if their daily dose of levodopa had been greater than or equal to 800 mg or if patients had moderate or severe dyskinesia before beginning treatment.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	To optimize an individual patient's response, reductions in daily levodopa dose or extending the interval between doses may be necessary.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In clinical studies, the average reduction in daily levodopa dose was about 25% in those patients requiring a levodopa dose reduction (more than 58% of patients with levodopa doses above 800 mg daily required such a reduction).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When entacapone is given in conjunction with levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, such as carbidopa, plasma levels of levodopa are greater and more sustained than after administration of levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is believed that at a given frequency of levodopa administration, these more sustained plasma levels of levodopa result in more constant dopaminergic stimulation in the brain, leading to greater effects on the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When 200 mg entacapone is administered together with levodopa and carbidopa, it increases the area under the curve (AUC) of levodopa by approximately 35%, and the elimination half-life of levodopa is prolonged from 1.3 hours to 2.4 hours.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When colesevelam is coadministered with glipizide ER, maximum plasma concentration and total exposure to glipizide is reduced.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The mean percentage increase in the GLUCOTROL AUC after fluconazole administration was 56.9% (range: 35 to 81).	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Therefore, GLUCOTROL should be administered at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam to ensure that colesevelam does not reduce the absorption of glipizide.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Total absorption and disposition of an oral dose was unaffected by food in normal volunteers, but absorption was delayed by about 40 minutes.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concurrent administration of lorazepam with valproate results in increased plasma concentrations and reduced clearance of lorazepam.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lorazepam dosage should be reduced to approximately 50% when co-administered with valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concurrent administration of lorazepam with probenecid may result in a more rapid onset or prolonged effect of lorazepam due to increased half-life and decreased total clearance.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lorazepam dosage needs to be reduced by approximately 50% when co-administered with probenecid.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effects of probenecid and valproate on lorazepam may be due to inhibition of glucuronidation.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Continue until methotrexate level is below 5 x 10-8 M (0.05 micromolar).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Continue Levoleucovorin for injection administration, hydration, and urinary alkalinization (pH 7.0 or greater) until the methotrexate level is below 5 x 10-8 M (0.05 micromolar).	Pharmacokinetic interaction

Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In addition to appropriate levoleucovorin for injection therapy, continue hydration and urinary alkalinization, and monitoring of fluid and electrolyte status, until the serum methotrexate level has fallen to below 0.05 micromolar and the renal failure has resolved.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effect of leu co vorin products on fluorouracil : Leucovorin products increase the toxicity of fluorouracil.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Leucovorin products increase the toxicities of fluorouracil.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Coadministration of ACTOS and gemfibrozil, a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, increases pioglitazone exposure approximately 3-fold.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of ACTOS is 15 mg daily when used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Strong CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g., gemfibrozil) increase pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CYP2C8 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may decrease pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Topiramate may decrease pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An inhibitor of CYP2C8 (e.g., gemfibrozil) significantly increases the exposure (area under the serum concentration-time curve or AUC) and half-life (t1/2) of pioglitazone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of ACTOS is 15 mg daily if used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An inducer of CYP2C8 (e.g., rifampin) may significantly decrease the exposure (AUC) of pioglitazone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A decrease in the exposure of pioglitazone and its active metabolites were noted with concomitant administration of pioglitazone and topiramate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food delays the Tmax to three to four hours but does not alter the extent of absorption (AUC).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In an in vitro study in human liver microsomes, inhibition of CYP2A6 hydroxylation of coumarin by fondaparinux (200 micromolar i.e., 350 mg/L) was 17 to 28%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effects of NUVIGIL on CYP3A4/5 Substrates The clearance of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A4/5 (e.g., steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, and triazolam) may be increased by NUVIGIL via induction of metabolic enzymes, which results in lower systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Blood levels of cyclosporine may be reduced when used with NUVIGIL.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effects of NUVIGIL on CYP2C19 Substrates Elimination of drugs that are substrates for CYP2C19 (e.g., phenytoin, diazepam, propranolol, omeprazole, and clomipramine) may be prolonged by NUVIGIL via inhibition of metabolic enzymes, with resultant higher systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cyclosporine: blood concentrations of cyclosporine may be reduced.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CYP2C19 substrates, such as omeprazole, phenytoin, and diazepam: exposure of these medications may be increased.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food effect on the overall bioavailability of NUVIGIL is considered minimal; however, time to reach peak concentration (tmax) may be delayed by approximately 2-4 hours in the fed state.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 250 mg resulted in a reduction in systemic exposure to midazolam by 32% after a single oral dose (5 mg) and 17% after a single intravenous dose (2 mg).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the blood levels and effectiveness of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A enzymes (e.g., steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, and triazolam) may be reduced after initiation of concomitant treatment with NUVIGIL.In a separate clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 250 mg with quetiapine (300 mg to 600 mg daily doses) resulted in a reduction in the mean systemic exposure of quetiapine by approximately 29%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 400 mg resulted in a 40% increase in exposure to omeprazole after a single oral dose (40 mg), as a result of moderate inhibition of CYP2C19 activity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Interactions with CNS Active Drugs Concomitant administration of NUVIGIL with quetiapine reduced the systemic exposure of quetiapine.Data specific to NUVIGIL drug-drug interaction potential with other CNS active drugs are not available.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant administration of modafinil with methylphenidate or dextroamphetamine produced no significant alterations on the pharmacokinetic profile of modafinil or either stimulant, even though the absorption of modafinil was delayed for approximately one hour.Concomitant modafinil or clomipramine did not alter the pharmacokinetic profile of either drug; however, one incident of increased levels of clomipramine and its active metabolite desmethylclomipramine was reported in a patient with narcolepsy during treatment with modafinil.Data specific to NUVIGIL or modafinil drug-drug interaction potential with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors are not available.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Barbiturates can induce hepatic microsomal enzymes, resulting in increased metabolism and decreased anticoagulant response of oral anticoagulants (eg, warfarin, acenocoumarol, dicumarol, and phenprocoumon).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Corticosteroids Barbiturates appear to enhance the metabolism of exogenous corticosteroids, probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Griseofulvin Phenobarbital appears to interfere with the absorption of orally administered griseofulvin, thus decreasing its blood level.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effect of the resultant decreased blood levels of griseofulvin on therapeutic response has not been established.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Doxycycline Phenobarbital has been shown to shorten the half-life of doxycycline for as long as 2 weeks after barbiturate therapy is discontinued.This mechanism is probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes that metabolize the antibiotic.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Sodium valproate and valproic acid increase the secobarbital sodium serum levels; therefore, secobarbital sodium blood levels should be monitored closely and appropriate dosage adjustments made as clinically indicated.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Estradiol, Estrone, Progesterone, and Other Steroidal Hormones Pretreatment with or concurrent administration of phenobarbital may decrease the effect of estradiol by increasing its metabolism.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hepatic enzyme-inducing drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone, rifampin) can increase valproate clearance, while enzyme inhibitors (e.g., felbamate) can decrease valproate clearance.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For example, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital (or primidone) can double the clearance of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thus, patients on monotherapy will generally have longer half-lives and higher concentrations than patients receiving polytherapy with antiepilepsy drugs.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Increasing the felbamate dose to 2,400 mg/day increased the mean valproate peak concentration to 133 mcg/mL (another 16% increase).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A decrease in valproate dosage may be necessary when felbamate therapy is initiated.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rifampin A study involving the administration of a single dose of valproate (7 mg/kg) 36 hours after 5 nights of daily dosing with rifampin (600 mg) revealed a 40% increase in the oral clearance of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rare postmarketing reports of concurrent use of valproate and amitriptyline resulting in an increased amitriptyline level have been received.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Consideration should be given to lowering the dose of amitriptyline/nortriptyline in the presence of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Carbamazepine/carbamazepine-10,11-Epoxide Serum levels of carbamazepine (CBZ) decreased 17% while that of carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide (CBZ-E) increased by 45% upon co-administration of valproate and CBZ to epileptic patients.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	The fraction of phenobarbital dose excreted unchanged increased by 50% in presence of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Serum barbiturate concentrations should be obtained, if possible, and the barbiturate dosage decreased, if appropriate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Rufinamide Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, rufinamide clearance was decreased by valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rufinamide concentrations were increased by <16% to 70%, dependent on concentration of valproate (with the larger increases being seen in pediatric patients at high doses or concentrations of valproate).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients stabilized on rufinamide before being prescribed valproate should begin valproate therapy at a low dose, and titrate to a clinically effective dose.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Similarly, patients on valproate should begin at a rufinamide dose lower than 10 mg/kg per day (pediatric patients) or 400 mg per day (adults).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Tolbutamide From in vitro experiments, the unbound fraction of tolbutamide was increased from 20% to 50% when added to plasma samples taken from patients treated with valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Zidovudine In six patients who were seropositive for HIV, the clearance of zidovudine (100 mg q8h) was decreased by 38% after administration of valproate (250 or 500 mg q8h); the half-life of zidovudine was unaffected.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lorazepam Concomitant administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and lorazepam (1 mg BID) in normal male volunteers (n = 9) was accompanied by a 17% decrease in the plasma clearance of lorazepam.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Co-administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and olanzapine (5 mg) to healthy adults (n=10) caused 15% reduction in Cmax and 35% reduction in AUC of olanzapine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Protein binding of valproate is reduced in the elderly, in patients with chronic hepatic diseases, in patients with renal impairment, and in the presence of other drugs (e.g., aspirin).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Conversely, valproate may displace certain protein-bound drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, warfarin, and tolbutamide).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For example, patients taking enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital) will clear valproate more rapidly.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dexamethasone: Steady-state trough concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide were about 56% higher when dexamethasone was coadministered with each dose of albendazole.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Steady-state trough concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide were about 56% higher when 8 mg dexamethasone was co-administered with each dose of albendazole (15 mg/kg/day) in 8 neurocysticercosis patients.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In the fed state, praziquantel (40 mg/kg) increased mean maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve of albendazole sulfoxide by about 50% in healthy subjects (n = 10) compared with a separate group of subjects (n = 6) given albendazole alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Albendazole sulfoxide concentrations in bile and cystic fluid were increased (about 2-fold) in hydatid cyst patients treated with cimetidine (10 mg/kg/day) (n = 7) compared with albendazole (20 mg/kg/day) alone (n = 12).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Oral bioavailability appears to be enhanced when albendazole is coadministered with a fatty meal (estimated fat content 40 grams) as evidenced by higher (up to 5-fold on average) plasma concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide as compared to the fasted state.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, CONTRAVE should not be taken with a high-fat meal because of a resulting significant increase in bupropion and naltrexone systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During concomitant use with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel), the maximum recommended daily dose of CONTRAVE is two tablets (one tablet each morning and evening).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6: Bupropion inhibits CYP2D6 and can increase concentrations of: antidepressants, (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and many tricyclics), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide): Consider dose reduction when using with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant Treatment with CYP2B6 Inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel) can increase bupropion exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Do not exceed one tablet twice daily when taken with CYP2B6 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Studies in animals demonstrate that the acute toxicity of bupropion is enhanced by the MAOI phenelzine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CONTRAVE increased metoprolol AUC and Cmax by approximately 4- and 2-fold, respectively, relative to metoprolol alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Similar clinical drug interactions resulting in increased pharmacokinetic exposure of CYP2D6 substrates have also been observed with bupropion as a single agent with desipramine or venlafaxine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Coadministration of CONTRAVE with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isozyme including certain antidepressants (SSRIs and many tricyclics), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If CONTRAVE is added to the treatment regimen of a patient already receiving a drug metabolized by CYP2D6, the need to decrease the dose of the original medication should be considered, particularly for those concomitant medications with a narrow therapeutic index.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Inhibitors of CYP2B6: Ticlopidine and Clopidogrel: Concomitant treatment with these drugs can increase bupropion exposure but decrease hydroxybupropion exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During concomitant use with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel), the CONTRAVE daily dose should not exceed two tablets (one tablet each morning and evening).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The systemic concentrations of substrate drugs transported by OCT2 (such as amantadine, amiloride, cimetidine, dopamine, famotidine, memantine, metformin, pindolol, procainamide, ranitidine, varenicline, oxaliplatin) are likely to increase as a result of reduced renal clearance when coadministered with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food Effect on Absorption When CONTRAVE was administered with a high-fat meal, the AUC and Cmax for naltrexone increased 2.1-fold and 3.7-fold, respectively, and the AUC and Cmax for bupropion increased 1.4-fold and 1.8-fold, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	At steady state, the food effect increased AUC and Cmax for naltrexone by 1.7-fold and 1.9-fold, respectively, and increased AUC and Cmax for bupropion by 1.1-fold and 1.3-fold, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thus, CONTRAVE should not be taken with high-fat meals because of the resulting significant increases in bupropion and naltrexone systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In vitro studies suggest that paroxetine, sertraline, norfluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and nelfinavir inhibit the hydroxylation of bupropion.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The systemic concentrations of substrate drugs transported by OCT2 are likely to increase as a result of reduced renal clearance when coadministered with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	It is believed that at a given frequency of levodopa administration, these more sustained plasma levels of levodopa result in more constant dopaminergic stimulation in the brain, leading to greater effects on the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When 200 mg entacapone is administered together with levodopa and carbidopa, it increases the area under the curve (AUC) of levodopa by approximately 35%, and the elimination half-life of levodopa is prolonged from 1.3 hours to 2.4 hours.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When colesevelam is coadministered with glipizide ER, maximum plasma concentration and total exposure to glipizide is reduced.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The mean percentage increase in the GLUCOTROL AUC after fluconazole administration was 56.9% (range: 35 to 81).	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Lorazepam dosage should be reduced to approximately 50% when co-administered with valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concurrent administration of lorazepam with probenecid may result in a more rapid onset or prolonged effect of lorazepam due to increased half-life and decreased total clearance.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lorazepam dosage needs to be reduced by approximately 50% when co-administered with probenecid.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	An inhibitor of CYP2C8 (e.g., gemfibrozil) significantly increases the exposure (area under the serum concentration-time curve or AUC) and half-life (t1/2) of pioglitazone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of ACTOS is 15 mg daily if used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An inducer of CYP2C8 (e.g., rifampin) may significantly decrease the exposure (AUC) of pioglitazone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Effects of NUVIGIL on CYP3A4/5 Substrates The clearance of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A4/5 (e.g., steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, and triazolam) may be increased by NUVIGIL via induction of metabolic enzymes, which results in lower systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Blood levels of cyclosporine may be reduced when used with NUVIGIL.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effects of NUVIGIL on CYP2C19 Substrates Elimination of drugs that are substrates for CYP2C19 (e.g., phenytoin, diazepam, propranolol, omeprazole, and clomipramine) may be prolonged by NUVIGIL via inhibition of metabolic enzymes, with resultant higher systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cyclosporine: blood concentrations of cyclosporine may be reduced.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CYP2C19 substrates, such as omeprazole, phenytoin, and diazepam: exposure of these medications may be increased.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food effect on the overall bioavailability of NUVIGIL is considered minimal; however, time to reach peak concentration (tmax) may be delayed by approximately 2-4 hours in the fed state.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 250 mg resulted in a reduction in systemic exposure to midazolam by 32% after a single oral dose (5 mg) and 17% after a single intravenous dose (2 mg).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the blood levels and effectiveness of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A enzymes (e.g., steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, and triazolam) may be reduced after initiation of concomitant treatment with NUVIGIL.In a separate clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 250 mg with quetiapine (300 mg to 600 mg daily doses) resulted in a reduction in the mean systemic exposure of quetiapine by approximately 29%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 400 mg resulted in a 40% increase in exposure to omeprazole after a single oral dose (40 mg), as a result of moderate inhibition of CYP2C19 activity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Concomitant administration of modafinil with methylphenidate or dextroamphetamine produced no significant alterations on the pharmacokinetic profile of modafinil or either stimulant, even though the absorption of modafinil was delayed for approximately one hour.Concomitant modafinil or clomipramine did not alter the pharmacokinetic profile of either drug; however, one incident of increased levels of clomipramine and its active metabolite desmethylclomipramine was reported in a patient with narcolepsy during treatment with modafinil.Data specific to NUVIGIL or modafinil drug-drug interaction potential with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors are not available.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Corticosteroids Barbiturates appear to enhance the metabolism of exogenous corticosteroids, probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Griseofulvin Phenobarbital appears to interfere with the absorption of orally administered griseofulvin, thus decreasing its blood level.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effect of the resultant decreased blood levels of griseofulvin on therapeutic response has not been established.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Doxycycline Phenobarbital has been shown to shorten the half-life of doxycycline for as long as 2 weeks after barbiturate therapy is discontinued.This mechanism is probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes that metabolize the antibiotic.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Sodium valproate and valproic acid increase the secobarbital sodium serum levels; therefore, secobarbital sodium blood levels should be monitored closely and appropriate dosage adjustments made as clinically indicated.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Estradiol, Estrone, Progesterone, and Other Steroidal Hormones Pretreatment with or concurrent administration of phenobarbital may decrease the effect of estradiol by increasing its metabolism.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hepatic enzyme-inducing drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone, rifampin) can increase valproate clearance, while enzyme inhibitors (e.g., felbamate) can decrease valproate clearance.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For example, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital (or primidone) can double the clearance of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Increasing the felbamate dose to 2,400 mg/day increased the mean valproate peak concentration to 133 mcg/mL (another 16% increase).	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	In the fed state, praziquantel (40 mg/kg) increased mean maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve of albendazole sulfoxide by about 50% in healthy subjects (n = 10) compared with a separate group of subjects (n = 6) given albendazole alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Albendazole sulfoxide concentrations in bile and cystic fluid were increased (about 2-fold) in hydatid cyst patients treated with cimetidine (10 mg/kg/day) (n = 7) compared with albendazole (20 mg/kg/day) alone (n = 12).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Oral bioavailability appears to be enhanced when albendazole is coadministered with a fatty meal (estimated fat content 40 grams) as evidenced by higher (up to 5-fold on average) plasma concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide as compared to the fasted state.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, CONTRAVE should not be taken with a high-fat meal because of a resulting significant increase in bupropion and naltrexone systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During concomitant use with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel), the maximum recommended daily dose of CONTRAVE is two tablets (one tablet each morning and evening).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6: Bupropion inhibits CYP2D6 and can increase concentrations of: antidepressants, (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and many tricyclics), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide): Consider dose reduction when using with CONTRAVE.

5	CONTRAVE increased metoprolol AUC and Cmax by approximately 4- and 2-fold, respectively, relative to metoprolol alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Similar clinical drug interactions resulting in increased pharmacokinetic exposure of CYP2D6 substrates have also been observed with bupropion as a single agent with desipramine or venlafaxine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Coadministration of CONTRAVE with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isozyme including certain antidepressants (SSRIs and many tricyclics), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If CONTRAVE is added to the treatment regimen of a patient already receiving a drug metabolized by CYP2D6, the need to decrease the dose of the original medication should be considered, particularly for those concomitant medications with a narrow therapeutic index.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Inhibitors of CYP2B6: Ticlopidine and Clopidogrel: Concomitant treatment with these drugs can increase bupropion exposure but decrease hydroxybupropion exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	The systemic concentrations of substrate drugs transported by OCT2 (such as amantadine, amiloride, cimetidine, dopamine, famotidine, memantine, metformin, pindolol, procainamide, ranitidine, varenicline, oxaliplatin) are likely to increase as a result of reduced renal clearance when coadministered with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food Effect on Absorption When CONTRAVE was administered with a high-fat meal, the AUC and Cmax for naltrexone increased 2.1-fold and 3.7-fold, respectively, and the AUC and Cmax for bupropion increased 1.4-fold and 1.8-fold, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	At steady state, the food effect increased AUC and Cmax for naltrexone by 1.7-fold and 1.9-fold, respectively, and increased AUC and Cmax for bupropion by 1.1-fold and 1.3-fold, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thus, CONTRAVE should not be taken with high-fat meals because of the resulting significant increases in bupropion and naltrexone systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In vitro studies suggest that paroxetine, sertraline, norfluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and nelfinavir inhibit the hydroxylation of bupropion.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The systemic concentrations of substrate drugs transported by OCT2 are likely to increase as a result of reduced renal clearance when coadministered with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	While not systematically studied, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or phenytoin may induce the metabolism of bupropion.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Chlorpheniramine may inhibit the hepatic metabolism of phenytoin, monitor phenytoin toxicity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Cimetidine Plus Probenecid: Acyclovir Cmax and AUC following a single dose of VALTREX (1 gram) increased by 30% and 78%, respectively, after a combination of cimetidine and probenecid, primarily due to a reduction in renal clearance of acyclovir.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Concomitant administration of atovaquone and indinavir did not result in any change in the steady<U+2011>state AUC and Cmax of indinavir but resulted in a decrease in the Ctrough of indinavir.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Caution should be exercised when prescribing atovaquone with indinavir due to the decrease in trough concentrations of indinavir.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dietary fat taken with atovaquone increases the rate and extent of absorption, increasing AUC 2 to 3 times and Cmax 5 times over fasting.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rifampin/Rifabutin: Concomitant administration of rifampin or rifabutin is known to reduce atovaquone concentrations by approximately 50% and 34%, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed in patients treated with DEXILANT.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Simultaneous administration of drugs that inhibit the activity of liver microsomal enzymes, i.e., CYP3A4 inhibitors such as cimetidine and ketoconazole, may prolong the half-life and decrease the plasma clearance of tinidazole, increasing the plasma concentrations of tinidazole.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cholestyramine: Cholestyramine was shown to decrease the oral bioavailability of metronidazole by 21%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Administration of Tindamax tablets with food resulted in a delay in T max of approximately 2 hours and a decline in Cmax of approximately 10%, compared to fasted conditions.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In clinical studies, the majority of patients required a decrease in daily levodopa dose if their daily dose of levodopa had been greater than or equal to 800 mg or if patients had moderate or severe dyskinesia before beginning treatment.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	To optimize an individual patient's response, reductions in daily levodopa dose or extending the interval between doses may be necessary.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In clinical studies, the average reduction in daily levodopa dose was about 25% in those patients requiring a levodopa dose reduction (more than 58% of patients with levodopa doses above 800 mg daily required such a reduction).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When entacapone is given in conjunction with levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, such as carbidopa, plasma levels of levodopa are greater and more sustained than after administration of levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is believed that at a given frequency of levodopa administration, these more sustained plasma levels of levodopa result in more constant dopaminergic stimulation in the brain, leading to greater effects on the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When 200 mg entacapone is administered together with levodopa and carbidopa, it increases the area under the curve (AUC) of levodopa by approximately 35%, and the elimination half-life of levodopa is prolonged from 1.3 hours to 2.4 hours.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When colesevelam is coadministered with glipizide ER, maximum plasma concentration and total exposure to glipizide is reduced.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The mean percentage increase in the GLUCOTROL AUC after fluconazole administration was 56.9% (range: 35 to 81).	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Lorazepam dosage should be reduced to approximately 50% when co-administered with valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concurrent administration of lorazepam with probenecid may result in a more rapid onset or prolonged effect of lorazepam due to increased half-life and decreased total clearance.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lorazepam dosage needs to be reduced by approximately 50% when co-administered with probenecid.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effects of probenecid and valproate on lorazepam may be due to inhibition of glucuronidation.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In addition to appropriate levoleucovorin for injection therapy, continue hydration and urinary alkalinization, and monitoring of fluid and electrolyte status, until the serum methotrexate level has fallen to below 0.05 micromolar and the renal failure has resolved.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effect of leu co vorin products on fluorouracil : Leucovorin products increase the toxicity of fluorouracil.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Leucovorin products increase the toxicities of fluorouracil.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Coadministration of ACTOS and gemfibrozil, a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, increases pioglitazone exposure approximately 3-fold.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of ACTOS is 15 mg daily when used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Strong CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g., gemfibrozil) increase pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CYP2C8 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may decrease pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Topiramate may decrease pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An inhibitor of CYP2C8 (e.g., gemfibrozil) significantly increases the exposure (area under the serum concentration-time curve or AUC) and half-life (t1/2) of pioglitazone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of ACTOS is 15 mg daily if used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An inducer of CYP2C8 (e.g., rifampin) may significantly decrease the exposure (AUC) of pioglitazone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A decrease in the exposure of pioglitazone and its active metabolites were noted with concomitant administration of pioglitazone and topiramate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food delays the Tmax to three to four hours but does not alter the extent of absorption (AUC).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In an in vitro study in human liver microsomes, inhibition of CYP2A6 hydroxylation of coumarin by fondaparinux (200 micromolar i.e., 350 mg/L) was 17 to 28%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effects of NUVIGIL on CYP3A4/5 Substrates The clearance of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A4/5 (e.g., steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, and triazolam) may be increased by NUVIGIL via induction of metabolic enzymes, which results in lower systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Blood levels of cyclosporine may be reduced when used with NUVIGIL.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effects of NUVIGIL on CYP2C19 Substrates Elimination of drugs that are substrates for CYP2C19 (e.g., phenytoin, diazepam, propranolol, omeprazole, and clomipramine) may be prolonged by NUVIGIL via inhibition of metabolic enzymes, with resultant higher systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cyclosporine: blood concentrations of cyclosporine may be reduced.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CYP2C19 substrates, such as omeprazole, phenytoin, and diazepam: exposure of these medications may be increased.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food effect on the overall bioavailability of NUVIGIL is considered minimal; however, time to reach peak concentration (tmax) may be delayed by approximately 2-4 hours in the fed state.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 250 mg resulted in a reduction in systemic exposure to midazolam by 32% after a single oral dose (5 mg) and 17% after a single intravenous dose (2 mg).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the blood levels and effectiveness of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A enzymes (e.g., steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, and triazolam) may be reduced after initiation of concomitant treatment with NUVIGIL.In a separate clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 250 mg with quetiapine (300 mg to 600 mg daily doses) resulted in a reduction in the mean systemic exposure of quetiapine by approximately 29%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 400 mg resulted in a 40% increase in exposure to omeprazole after a single oral dose (40 mg), as a result of moderate inhibition of CYP2C19 activity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Interactions with CNS Active Drugs Concomitant administration of NUVIGIL with quetiapine reduced the systemic exposure of quetiapine.Data specific to NUVIGIL drug-drug interaction potential with other CNS active drugs are not available.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant administration of modafinil with methylphenidate or dextroamphetamine produced no significant alterations on the pharmacokinetic profile of modafinil or either stimulant, even though the absorption of modafinil was delayed for approximately one hour.Concomitant modafinil or clomipramine did not alter the pharmacokinetic profile of either drug; however, one incident of increased levels of clomipramine and its active metabolite desmethylclomipramine was reported in a patient with narcolepsy during treatment with modafinil.Data specific to NUVIGIL or modafinil drug-drug interaction potential with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors are not available.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Barbiturates can induce hepatic microsomal enzymes, resulting in increased metabolism and decreased anticoagulant response of oral anticoagulants (eg, warfarin, acenocoumarol, dicumarol, and phenprocoumon).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Corticosteroids Barbiturates appear to enhance the metabolism of exogenous corticosteroids, probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Griseofulvin Phenobarbital appears to interfere with the absorption of orally administered griseofulvin, thus decreasing its blood level.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effect of the resultant decreased blood levels of griseofulvin on therapeutic response has not been established.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Doxycycline Phenobarbital has been shown to shorten the half-life of doxycycline for as long as 2 weeks after barbiturate therapy is discontinued.This mechanism is probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes that metabolize the antibiotic.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Sodium valproate and valproic acid increase the secobarbital sodium serum levels; therefore, secobarbital sodium blood levels should be monitored closely and appropriate dosage adjustments made as clinically indicated.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Estradiol, Estrone, Progesterone, and Other Steroidal Hormones Pretreatment with or concurrent administration of phenobarbital may decrease the effect of estradiol by increasing its metabolism.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hepatic enzyme-inducing drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone, rifampin) can increase valproate clearance, while enzyme inhibitors (e.g., felbamate) can decrease valproate clearance.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For example, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital (or primidone) can double the clearance of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thus, patients on monotherapy will generally have longer half-lives and higher concentrations than patients receiving polytherapy with antiepilepsy drugs.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Increasing the felbamate dose to 2,400 mg/day increased the mean valproate peak concentration to 133 mcg/mL (another 16% increase).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A decrease in valproate dosage may be necessary when felbamate therapy is initiated.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rifampin A study involving the administration of a single dose of valproate (7 mg/kg) 36 hours after 5 nights of daily dosing with rifampin (600 mg) revealed a 40% increase in the oral clearance of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rare postmarketing reports of concurrent use of valproate and amitriptyline resulting in an increased amitriptyline level have been received.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Consideration should be given to lowering the dose of amitriptyline/nortriptyline in the presence of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Rufinamide Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, rufinamide clearance was decreased by valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rufinamide concentrations were increased by <16% to 70%, dependent on concentration of valproate (with the larger increases being seen in pediatric patients at high doses or concentrations of valproate).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients stabilized on rufinamide before being prescribed valproate should begin valproate therapy at a low dose, and titrate to a clinically effective dose.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Similarly, patients on valproate should begin at a rufinamide dose lower than 10 mg/kg per day (pediatric patients) or 400 mg per day (adults).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Tolbutamide From in vitro experiments, the unbound fraction of tolbutamide was increased from 20% to 50% when added to plasma samples taken from patients treated with valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Co-administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and olanzapine (5 mg) to healthy adults (n=10) caused 15% reduction in Cmax and 35% reduction in AUC of olanzapine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Protein binding of valproate is reduced in the elderly, in patients with chronic hepatic diseases, in patients with renal impairment, and in the presence of other drugs (e.g., aspirin).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Conversely, valproate may displace certain protein-bound drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, warfarin, and tolbutamide).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For example, patients taking enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital) will clear valproate more rapidly.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	In the fed state, praziquantel (40 mg/kg) increased mean maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve of albendazole sulfoxide by about 50% in healthy subjects (n = 10) compared with a separate group of subjects (n = 6) given albendazole alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Albendazole sulfoxide concentrations in bile and cystic fluid were increased (about 2-fold) in hydatid cyst patients treated with cimetidine (10 mg/kg/day) (n = 7) compared with albendazole (20 mg/kg/day) alone (n = 12).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Oral bioavailability appears to be enhanced when albendazole is coadministered with a fatty meal (estimated fat content 40 grams) as evidenced by higher (up to 5-fold on average) plasma concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide as compared to the fasted state.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, CONTRAVE should not be taken with a high-fat meal because of a resulting significant increase in bupropion and naltrexone systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During concomitant use with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel), the maximum recommended daily dose of CONTRAVE is two tablets (one tablet each morning and evening).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6: Bupropion inhibits CYP2D6 and can increase concentrations of: antidepressants, (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and many tricyclics), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide): Consider dose reduction when using with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant Treatment with CYP2B6 Inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel) can increase bupropion exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Do not exceed one tablet twice daily when taken with CYP2B6 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Studies in animals demonstrate that the acute toxicity of bupropion is enhanced by the MAOI phenelzine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CONTRAVE increased metoprolol AUC and Cmax by approximately 4- and 2-fold, respectively, relative to metoprolol alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Similar clinical drug interactions resulting in increased pharmacokinetic exposure of CYP2D6 substrates have also been observed with bupropion as a single agent with desipramine or venlafaxine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Coadministration of CONTRAVE with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isozyme including certain antidepressants (SSRIs and many tricyclics), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If CONTRAVE is added to the treatment regimen of a patient already receiving a drug metabolized by CYP2D6, the need to decrease the dose of the original medication should be considered, particularly for those concomitant medications with a narrow therapeutic index.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Inhibitors of CYP2B6: Ticlopidine and Clopidogrel: Concomitant treatment with these drugs can increase bupropion exposure but decrease hydroxybupropion exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During concomitant use with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel), the CONTRAVE daily dose should not exceed two tablets (one tablet each morning and evening).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The systemic concentrations of substrate drugs transported by OCT2 (such as amantadine, amiloride, cimetidine, dopamine, famotidine, memantine, metformin, pindolol, procainamide, ranitidine, varenicline, oxaliplatin) are likely to increase as a result of reduced renal clearance when coadministered with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food Effect on Absorption When CONTRAVE was administered with a high-fat meal, the AUC and Cmax for naltrexone increased 2.1-fold and 3.7-fold, respectively, and the AUC and Cmax for bupropion increased 1.4-fold and 1.8-fold, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	At steady state, the food effect increased AUC and Cmax for naltrexone by 1.7-fold and 1.9-fold, respectively, and increased AUC and Cmax for bupropion by 1.1-fold and 1.3-fold, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thus, CONTRAVE should not be taken with high-fat meals because of the resulting significant increases in bupropion and naltrexone systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In vitro studies suggest that paroxetine, sertraline, norfluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and nelfinavir inhibit the hydroxylation of bupropion.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The systemic concentrations of substrate drugs transported by OCT2 are likely to increase as a result of reduced renal clearance when coadministered with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	While not systematically studied, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or phenytoin may induce the metabolism of bupropion.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Chlorpheniramine may inhibit the hepatic metabolism of phenytoin, monitor phenytoin toxicity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effect on Food In food-effect studies in healthy subjects receiving DEXILANT under various fed conditions compared to fasting, increases in Cmax ranged from 12 to 55%, increases in AUC ranged from 9 to 37%, and Tmax varied (ranging from a decrease of 0.7 hours to an increase of three hours).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The mean AUC of the active metabolite of clopidogrel was reduced by approximately 9% (mean AUC ratio was 91%, with 90% CI of 86 to 97%) when DEXILANT was co-administered compared to administration of clopidogrel alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lithium generally should not be given with diuretics because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A number of drugs, including ethacrynic acid, have been shown to displace warfarin from plasma protein; a reduction in the usual anticoagulant dosage may be required in patients receiving both drugs.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lithium: Metronidazole has been reported to elevate serum lithium levels.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Phenytoin, Fosphenytoin: Concomitant administration of oral metronidazole and intravenous phenytoin was reported to result in prolongation of the half-life and reduction in the clearance of phenytoin.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	CYP3A4 Inducers and Inhibitors: Simultaneous administration of tinidazole with drugs that induce liver microsomal enzymes, i.e., CYP3A4 inducers such as phenobarbital, rifampin, phenytoin, and fosphenytoin (a pro-drug of phenytoin), may accelerate the elimination of tinidazole, decreasing the plasma level of tinidazole.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Simultaneous administration of drugs that inhibit the activity of liver microsomal enzymes, i.e., CYP3A4 inhibitors such as cimetidine and ketoconazole, may prolong the half-life and decrease the plasma clearance of tinidazole, increasing the plasma concentrations of tinidazole.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cholestyramine: Cholestyramine was shown to decrease the oral bioavailability of metronidazole by 21%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Administration of Tindamax tablets with food resulted in a delay in T max of approximately 2 hours and a decline in Cmax of approximately 10%, compared to fasted conditions.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In clinical studies, the majority of patients required a decrease in daily levodopa dose if their daily dose of levodopa had been greater than or equal to 800 mg or if patients had moderate or severe dyskinesia before beginning treatment.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	To optimize an individual patient's response, reductions in daily levodopa dose or extending the interval between doses may be necessary.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In clinical studies, the average reduction in daily levodopa dose was about 25% in those patients requiring a levodopa dose reduction (more than 58% of patients with levodopa doses above 800 mg daily required such a reduction).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When entacapone is given in conjunction with levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, such as carbidopa, plasma levels of levodopa are greater and more sustained than after administration of levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is believed that at a given frequency of levodopa administration, these more sustained plasma levels of levodopa result in more constant dopaminergic stimulation in the brain, leading to greater effects on the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When 200 mg entacapone is administered together with levodopa and carbidopa, it increases the area under the curve (AUC) of levodopa by approximately 35%, and the elimination half-life of levodopa is prolonged from 1.3 hours to 2.4 hours.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When colesevelam is coadministered with glipizide ER, maximum plasma concentration and total exposure to glipizide is reduced.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The mean percentage increase in the GLUCOTROL AUC after fluconazole administration was 56.9% (range: 35 to 81).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In studies assessing the effect of colesevelam on the pharmacokinetics of glipizide ER in healthy volunteers, reductions in glipizide AUC0<U+2013><U+221E> and Cmax of 12% and 13%, respectively were observed when colesevelam was coadministered with glipizide ER.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, GLUCOTROL should be administered at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam to ensure that colesevelam does not reduce the absorption of glipizide.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Total absorption and disposition of an oral dose was unaffected by food in normal volunteers, but absorption was delayed by about 40 minutes.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concurrent administration of lorazepam with valproate results in increased plasma concentrations and reduced clearance of lorazepam.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lorazepam dosage should be reduced to approximately 50% when co-administered with valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concurrent administration of lorazepam with probenecid may result in a more rapid onset or prolonged effect of lorazepam due to increased half-life and decreased total clearance.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lorazepam dosage needs to be reduced by approximately 50% when co-administered with probenecid.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effects of probenecid and valproate on lorazepam may be due to inhibition of glucuronidation.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Continue until methotrexate level is below 5 x 10-8 M (0.05 micromolar).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Continue Levoleucovorin for injection administration, hydration, and urinary alkalinization (pH 7.0 or greater) until the methotrexate level is below 5 x 10-8 M (0.05 micromolar).	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Continue 7.5 mg by intravenous infusion every 6 hours, until methotrexate level is less than 0.05 micromolar.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Delayed early methotrexate elimination and/or evidence of acute renal injury* Serum methotrexate level of 50 micromolar or more at 24 hours, or 5 micromolar or more at 48 hours after administration, OR 100% or greater increase in serum creatinine level at 24 hours after methotrexate administration (e.g., an increase from 0.5 mg/dL to a level of 1 mg/dL or more).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In addition to appropriate levoleucovorin for injection therapy, continue hydration and urinary alkalinization, and monitoring of fluid and electrolyte status, until the serum methotrexate level has fallen to below 0.05 micromolar and the renal failure has resolved.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effect of leu co vorin products on fluorouracil : Leucovorin products increase the toxicity of fluorouracil.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Leucovorin products increase the toxicities of fluorouracil.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Coadministration of ACTOS and gemfibrozil, a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, increases pioglitazone exposure approximately 3-fold.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of ACTOS is 15 mg daily when used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Strong CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g., gemfibrozil) increase pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CYP2C8 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may decrease pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Topiramate may decrease pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An inhibitor of CYP2C8 (e.g., gemfibrozil) significantly increases the exposure (area under the serum concentration-time curve or AUC) and half-life (t1/2) of pioglitazone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of ACTOS is 15 mg daily if used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An inducer of CYP2C8 (e.g., rifampin) may significantly decrease the exposure (AUC) of pioglitazone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A decrease in the exposure of pioglitazone and its active metabolites were noted with concomitant administration of pioglitazone and topiramate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food delays the Tmax to three to four hours but does not alter the extent of absorption (AUC).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In an in vitro study in human liver microsomes, inhibition of CYP2A6 hydroxylation of coumarin by fondaparinux (200 micromolar i.e., 350 mg/L) was 17 to 28%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effects of NUVIGIL on CYP3A4/5 Substrates The clearance of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A4/5 (e.g., steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, and triazolam) may be increased by NUVIGIL via induction of metabolic enzymes, which results in lower systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Blood levels of cyclosporine may be reduced when used with NUVIGIL.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effects of NUVIGIL on CYP2C19 Substrates Elimination of drugs that are substrates for CYP2C19 (e.g., phenytoin, diazepam, propranolol, omeprazole, and clomipramine) may be prolonged by NUVIGIL via inhibition of metabolic enzymes, with resultant higher systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cyclosporine: blood concentrations of cyclosporine may be reduced.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CYP2C19 substrates, such as omeprazole, phenytoin, and diazepam: exposure of these medications may be increased.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food effect on the overall bioavailability of NUVIGIL is considered minimal; however, time to reach peak concentration (tmax) may be delayed by approximately 2-4 hours in the fed state.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 250 mg resulted in a reduction in systemic exposure to midazolam by 32% after a single oral dose (5 mg) and 17% after a single intravenous dose (2 mg).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the blood levels and effectiveness of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A enzymes (e.g., steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, and triazolam) may be reduced after initiation of concomitant treatment with NUVIGIL.In a separate clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 250 mg with quetiapine (300 mg to 600 mg daily doses) resulted in a reduction in the mean systemic exposure of quetiapine by approximately 29%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 400 mg resulted in a 40% increase in exposure to omeprazole after a single oral dose (40 mg), as a result of moderate inhibition of CYP2C19 activity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Interactions with CNS Active Drugs Concomitant administration of NUVIGIL with quetiapine reduced the systemic exposure of quetiapine.Data specific to NUVIGIL drug-drug interaction potential with other CNS active drugs are not available.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant administration of modafinil with methylphenidate or dextroamphetamine produced no significant alterations on the pharmacokinetic profile of modafinil or either stimulant, even though the absorption of modafinil was delayed for approximately one hour.Concomitant modafinil or clomipramine did not alter the pharmacokinetic profile of either drug; however, one incident of increased levels of clomipramine and its active metabolite desmethylclomipramine was reported in a patient with narcolepsy during treatment with modafinil.Data specific to NUVIGIL or modafinil drug-drug interaction potential with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors are not available.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Barbiturates can induce hepatic microsomal enzymes, resulting in increased metabolism and decreased anticoagulant response of oral anticoagulants (eg, warfarin, acenocoumarol, dicumarol, and phenprocoumon).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Corticosteroids Barbiturates appear to enhance the metabolism of exogenous corticosteroids, probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Griseofulvin Phenobarbital appears to interfere with the absorption of orally administered griseofulvin, thus decreasing its blood level.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effect of the resultant decreased blood levels of griseofulvin on therapeutic response has not been established.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Doxycycline Phenobarbital has been shown to shorten the half-life of doxycycline for as long as 2 weeks after barbiturate therapy is discontinued.This mechanism is probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes that metabolize the antibiotic.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Sodium valproate and valproic acid increase the secobarbital sodium serum levels; therefore, secobarbital sodium blood levels should be monitored closely and appropriate dosage adjustments made as clinically indicated.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Estradiol, Estrone, Progesterone, and Other Steroidal Hormones Pretreatment with or concurrent administration of phenobarbital may decrease the effect of estradiol by increasing its metabolism.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hepatic enzyme-inducing drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone, rifampin) can increase valproate clearance, while enzyme inhibitors (e.g., felbamate) can decrease valproate clearance.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For example, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital (or primidone) can double the clearance of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thus, patients on monotherapy will generally have longer half-lives and higher concentrations than patients receiving polytherapy with antiepilepsy drugs.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drugs for which a potentially important interaction has been observed Aspirin A study involving the co-administration of aspirin at antipyretic doses (11 to 16 mg/kg) with valproate to pediatric patients (n = 6) revealed a decrease in protein binding and an inhibition of metabolism of valproate.

5	Increasing the felbamate dose to 2,400 mg/day increased the mean valproate peak concentration to 133 mcg/mL (another 16% increase).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A decrease in valproate dosage may be necessary when felbamate therapy is initiated.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rifampin A study involving the administration of a single dose of valproate (7 mg/kg) 36 hours after 5 nights of daily dosing with rifampin (600 mg) revealed a 40% increase in the oral clearance of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rare postmarketing reports of concurrent use of valproate and amitriptyline resulting in an increased amitriptyline level have been received.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Consideration should be given to lowering the dose of amitriptyline/nortriptyline in the presence of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Carbamazepine/carbamazepine-10,11-Epoxide Serum levels of carbamazepine (CBZ) decreased 17% while that of carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide (CBZ-E) increased by 45% upon co-administration of valproate and CBZ to epileptic patients.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Administration of a single ethosuximide dose of 500 mg with valproate (800 to 1,600 mg/day) to healthy volunteers (n = 6) was accompanied by a 25% increase in elimination half-life of ethosuximide and a 15% decrease in its total clearance as compared to ethosuximide alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lamotrigine In a steady-state study involving 10 healthy volunteers, the elimination half-life of lamotrigine increased from 26 to 70 hours with valproate co-administration (a 165% increase).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The dose of lamotrigine should be reduced when co-administered with valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Phenobarbital Valproate was found to inhibit the metabolism of phenobarbital.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Co-administration of valproate (250 mg BID for 14 days) with phenobarbital to normal subjects (n = 6) resulted in a 50% increase in half-life and a 30% decrease in plasma clearance of phenobarbital (60 mg single-dose).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The fraction of phenobarbital dose excreted unchanged increased by 50% in presence of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Serum barbiturate concentrations should be obtained, if possible, and the barbiturate dosage decreased, if appropriate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Phenytoin Valproate displaces phenytoin from its plasma albumin binding sites and inhibits its hepatic metabolism.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Co-administration of valproate (400 mg TID) with phenytoin (250 mg) in normal volunteers (n = 7) was associated with a 60% increase in the free fraction of phenytoin.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Both the clearance and apparent volume of distribution of free phenytoin were reduced by 25%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Propofol The concomitant use of valproate and propofol may lead to increased blood levels of propofol.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Reduce the dose of propofol when co-administering with valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rufinamide Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, rufinamide clearance was decreased by valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rufinamide concentrations were increased by <16% to 70%, dependent on concentration of valproate (with the larger increases being seen in pediatric patients at high doses or concentrations of valproate).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients stabilized on rufinamide before being prescribed valproate should begin valproate therapy at a low dose, and titrate to a clinically effective dose.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Similarly, patients on valproate should begin at a rufinamide dose lower than 10 mg/kg per day (pediatric patients) or 400 mg per day (adults).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Tolbutamide From in vitro experiments, the unbound fraction of tolbutamide was increased from 20% to 50% when added to plasma samples taken from patients treated with valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Zidovudine In six patients who were seropositive for HIV, the clearance of zidovudine (100 mg q8h) was decreased by 38% after administration of valproate (250 or 500 mg q8h); the half-life of zidovudine was unaffected.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Lorazepam Concomitant administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and lorazepam (1 mg BID) in normal male volunteers (n = 9) was accompanied by a 17% decrease in the plasma clearance of lorazepam.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Co-administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and olanzapine (5 mg) to healthy adults (n=10) caused 15% reduction in Cmax and 35% reduction in AUC of olanzapine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Protein binding of valproate is reduced in the elderly, in patients with chronic hepatic diseases, in patients with renal impairment, and in the presence of other drugs (e.g., aspirin).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Conversely, valproate may displace certain protein-bound drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, warfarin, and tolbutamide).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For example, patients taking enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital) will clear valproate more rapidly.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dexamethasone: Steady-state trough concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide were about 56% higher when dexamethasone was coadministered with each dose of albendazole.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Praziquantel: In the fed state increased mean maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve of albendazole sulfoxide by about 50% in healthy subjects.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cimetidine: Increased albendazole sulfoxide concentrations in bile and cystic fluid by about 2-fold in hydatid cyst patients.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Steady-state trough concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide were about 56% higher when 8 mg dexamethasone was co-administered with each dose of albendazole (15 mg/kg/day) in 8 neurocysticercosis patients.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In the fed state, praziquantel (40 mg/kg) increased mean maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve of albendazole sulfoxide by about 50% in healthy subjects (n = 10) compared with a separate group of subjects (n = 6) given albendazole alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Albendazole sulfoxide concentrations in bile and cystic fluid were increased (about 2-fold) in hydatid cyst patients treated with cimetidine (10 mg/kg/day) (n = 7) compared with albendazole (20 mg/kg/day) alone (n = 12).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Oral bioavailability appears to be enhanced when albendazole is coadministered with a fatty meal (estimated fat content 40 grams) as evidenced by higher (up to 5-fold on average) plasma concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide as compared to the fasted state.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, CONTRAVE should not be taken with a high-fat meal because of a resulting significant increase in bupropion and naltrexone systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During concomitant use with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel), the maximum recommended daily dose of CONTRAVE is two tablets (one tablet each morning and evening).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6: Bupropion inhibits CYP2D6 and can increase concentrations of: antidepressants, (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and many tricyclics), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide): Consider dose reduction when using with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant Treatment with CYP2B6 Inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel) can increase bupropion exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Do not exceed one tablet twice daily when taken with CYP2B6 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Studies in animals demonstrate that the acute toxicity of bupropion is enhanced by the MAOI phenelzine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CONTRAVE increased metoprolol AUC and Cmax by approximately 4- and 2-fold, respectively, relative to metoprolol alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Similar clinical drug interactions resulting in increased pharmacokinetic exposure of CYP2D6 substrates have also been observed with bupropion as a single agent with desipramine or venlafaxine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Coadministration of CONTRAVE with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isozyme including certain antidepressants (SSRIs and many tricyclics), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If CONTRAVE is added to the treatment regimen of a patient already receiving a drug metabolized by CYP2D6, the need to decrease the dose of the original medication should be considered, particularly for those concomitant medications with a narrow therapeutic index.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Inhibitors of CYP2B6: Ticlopidine and Clopidogrel: Concomitant treatment with these drugs can increase bupropion exposure but decrease hydroxybupropion exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During concomitant use with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel), the CONTRAVE daily dose should not exceed two tablets (one tablet each morning and evening).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The systemic concentrations of substrate drugs transported by OCT2 (such as amantadine, amiloride, cimetidine, dopamine, famotidine, memantine, metformin, pindolol, procainamide, ranitidine, varenicline, oxaliplatin) are likely to increase as a result of reduced renal clearance when coadministered with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food Effect on Absorption When CONTRAVE was administered with a high-fat meal, the AUC and Cmax for naltrexone increased 2.1-fold and 3.7-fold, respectively, and the AUC and Cmax for bupropion increased 1.4-fold and 1.8-fold, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	At steady state, the food effect increased AUC and Cmax for naltrexone by 1.7-fold and 1.9-fold, respectively, and increased AUC and Cmax for bupropion by 1.1-fold and 1.3-fold, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thus, CONTRAVE should not be taken with high-fat meals because of the resulting significant increases in bupropion and naltrexone systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In vitro studies suggest that paroxetine, sertraline, norfluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and nelfinavir inhibit the hydroxylation of bupropion.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The systemic concentrations of substrate drugs transported by OCT2 are likely to increase as a result of reduced renal clearance when coadministered with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	While not systematically studied, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or phenytoin may induce the metabolism of bupropion.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Chlorpheniramine may inhibit the hepatic metabolism of phenytoin, monitor phenytoin toxicity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The concurrent use of drugs that preferentially induce codeine N-demethylation (via CYP3A4) may increase the plasma concentrations of codeine<U+2019>s inactive metabolite norcodeine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drugs that inhibit codeine O-demethylation (via CYP2D6), may decrease the plasma concentration of codeine<U+2019>s active metabolites, morphine and morphine-6-glucuronide.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Adverse event reports in the literature suggest a possible drug interaction involving increased serum phenytoin levels and phenytoin toxicity when chlorpheniramine and phenytoin are co-administered.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The exact mechanism for this interaction is not known, however it is believed that chlorpheniramine may inhibit the hepatic metabolism of phenytoin.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	There was a slight increase in the area under the curve (AUC, 11%) and mean peak drug concentration (Cmax, 18%) of digoxin with the coadministration of 100 mg sitagliptin for 10 days.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cimetidine: Acyclovir Cmax and AUC following a single dose of VALTREX (1 gram) increased by 8% and 32%, respectively, after a single dose of cimetidine (800 mg).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cimetidine Plus Probenecid: Acyclovir Cmax and AUC following a single dose of VALTREX (1 gram) increased by 30% and 78%, respectively, after a combination of cimetidine and probenecid, primarily due to a reduction in renal clearance of acyclovir.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Probenecid: Acyclovir Cmax and AUC following a single dose of VALTREX (1 gram) increased by 22% and 49%, respectively, after probenecid (1 gram).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Administration with rifampin or rifabutin is known to reduce atovaquone concentrations; concomitant use with MALARONE is not recommended.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant administration of rifampin or rifabutin is known to reduce atovaquone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant treatment with tetracycline has been associated with a reduction in plasma concentrations of atovaquone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	While antiemetics may be indicated for patients receiving MALARONE, metoclopramide may reduce the bioavailability of atovaquone and should be used only if other antiemetics are not available.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant administration of atovaquone and indinavir did not result in any change in the steady<U+2011>state AUC and Cmax of indinavir but resulted in a decrease in the Ctrough of indinavir.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Caution should be exercised when prescribing atovaquone with indinavir due to the decrease in trough concentrations of indinavir.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Dietary fat taken with atovaquone increases the rate and extent of absorption, increasing AUC 2 to 3 times and Cmax 5 times over fasting.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rifampin/Rifabutin: Concomitant administration of rifampin or rifabutin is known to reduce atovaquone concentrations by approximately 50% and 34%, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Metoclopramide: Concomitant treatment with metoclopramide has been associated with decreased bioavailability of atovaquone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Indinavir: Concomitant administration of atovaquone (750 mg twice daily with food for 14 days) and indinavir (800 mg three times daily without food for 14 days) did not result in any change in the steady<U+2011>state AUC and Cmax of indinavir but resulted in a decrease in the Ctrough of indinavir (23% decrease [90% CI = 8%, 35%]).

5	Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed in patients treated with DEXILANT.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Simultaneous administration of drugs that inhibit the activity of liver microsomal enzymes, i.e., CYP3A4 inhibitors such as cimetidine and ketoconazole, may prolong the half-life and decrease the plasma clearance of tinidazole, increasing the plasma concentrations of tinidazole.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Administration of Tindamax tablets with food resulted in a delay in T max of approximately 2 hours and a decline in Cmax of approximately 10%, compared to fasted conditions.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In clinical studies, the majority of patients required a decrease in daily levodopa dose if their daily dose of levodopa had been greater than or equal to 800 mg or if patients had moderate or severe dyskinesia before beginning treatment.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	To optimize an individual patient's response, reductions in daily levodopa dose or extending the interval between doses may be necessary.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In clinical studies, the average reduction in daily levodopa dose was about 25% in those patients requiring a levodopa dose reduction (more than 58% of patients with levodopa doses above 800 mg daily required such a reduction).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When entacapone is given in conjunction with levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, such as carbidopa, plasma levels of levodopa are greater and more sustained than after administration of levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	It is believed that at a given frequency of levodopa administration, these more sustained plasma levels of levodopa result in more constant dopaminergic stimulation in the brain, leading to greater effects on the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When 200 mg entacapone is administered together with levodopa and carbidopa, it increases the area under the curve (AUC) of levodopa by approximately 35%, and the elimination half-life of levodopa is prolonged from 1.3 hours to 2.4 hours.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	When colesevelam is coadministered with glipizide ER, maximum plasma concentration and total exposure to glipizide is reduced.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The mean percentage increase in the GLUCOTROL AUC after fluconazole administration was 56.9% (range: 35 to 81).	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Lorazepam dosage needs to be reduced by approximately 50% when co-administered with probenecid.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The effects of probenecid and valproate on lorazepam may be due to inhibition of glucuronidation.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In addition to appropriate levoleucovorin for injection therapy, continue hydration and urinary alkalinization, and monitoring of fluid and electrolyte status, until the serum methotrexate level has fallen to below 0.05 micromolar and the renal failure has resolved.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effect of leu co vorin products on fluorouracil : Leucovorin products increase the toxicity of fluorouracil.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Coadministration of ACTOS and gemfibrozil, a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, increases pioglitazone exposure approximately 3-fold.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of ACTOS is 15 mg daily when used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Strong CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g., gemfibrozil) increase pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CYP2C8 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may decrease pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Topiramate may decrease pioglitazone concentrations.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An inhibitor of CYP2C8 (e.g., gemfibrozil) significantly increases the exposure (area under the serum concentration-time curve or AUC) and half-life (t1/2) of pioglitazone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of ACTOS is 15 mg daily if used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	An inducer of CYP2C8 (e.g., rifampin) may significantly decrease the exposure (AUC) of pioglitazone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	A decrease in the exposure of pioglitazone and its active metabolites were noted with concomitant administration of pioglitazone and topiramate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food delays the Tmax to three to four hours but does not alter the extent of absorption (AUC).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In an in vitro study in human liver microsomes, inhibition of CYP2A6 hydroxylation of coumarin by fondaparinux (200 micromolar i.e., 350 mg/L) was 17 to 28%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effects of NUVIGIL on CYP3A4/5 Substrates The clearance of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A4/5 (e.g., steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, and triazolam) may be increased by NUVIGIL via induction of metabolic enzymes, which results in lower systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Blood levels of cyclosporine may be reduced when used with NUVIGIL.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Effects of NUVIGIL on CYP2C19 Substrates Elimination of drugs that are substrates for CYP2C19 (e.g., phenytoin, diazepam, propranolol, omeprazole, and clomipramine) may be prolonged by NUVIGIL via inhibition of metabolic enzymes, with resultant higher systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Cyclosporine: blood concentrations of cyclosporine may be reduced.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CYP2C19 substrates, such as omeprazole, phenytoin, and diazepam: exposure of these medications may be increased.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food effect on the overall bioavailability of NUVIGIL is considered minimal; however, time to reach peak concentration (tmax) may be delayed by approximately 2-4 hours in the fed state.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 250 mg resulted in a reduction in systemic exposure to midazolam by 32% after a single oral dose (5 mg) and 17% after a single intravenous dose (2 mg).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Therefore, the blood levels and effectiveness of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A enzymes (e.g., steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, and triazolam) may be reduced after initiation of concomitant treatment with NUVIGIL.In a separate clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 250 mg with quetiapine (300 mg to 600 mg daily doses) resulted in a reduction in the mean systemic exposure of quetiapine by approximately 29%.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In a clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 400 mg resulted in a 40% increase in exposure to omeprazole after a single oral dose (40 mg), as a result of moderate inhibition of CYP2C19 activity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Interactions with CNS Active Drugs Concomitant administration of NUVIGIL with quetiapine reduced the systemic exposure of quetiapine.Data specific to NUVIGIL drug-drug interaction potential with other CNS active drugs are not available.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant administration of modafinil with methylphenidate or dextroamphetamine produced no significant alterations on the pharmacokinetic profile of modafinil or either stimulant, even though the absorption of modafinil was delayed for approximately one hour.Concomitant modafinil or clomipramine did not alter the pharmacokinetic profile of either drug; however, one incident of increased levels of clomipramine and its active metabolite desmethylclomipramine was reported in a patient with narcolepsy during treatment with modafinil.Data specific to NUVIGIL or modafinil drug-drug interaction potential with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors are not available.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Barbiturates can induce hepatic microsomal enzymes, resulting in increased metabolism and decreased anticoagulant response of oral anticoagulants (eg, warfarin, acenocoumarol, dicumarol, and phenprocoumon).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Corticosteroids Barbiturates appear to enhance the metabolism of exogenous corticosteroids, probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	The effect of the resultant decreased blood levels of griseofulvin on therapeutic response has not been established.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Doxycycline Phenobarbital has been shown to shorten the half-life of doxycycline for as long as 2 weeks after barbiturate therapy is discontinued.This mechanism is probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes that metabolize the antibiotic.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Sodium valproate and valproic acid increase the secobarbital sodium serum levels; therefore, secobarbital sodium blood levels should be monitored closely and appropriate dosage adjustments made as clinically indicated.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Estradiol, Estrone, Progesterone, and Other Steroidal Hormones Pretreatment with or concurrent administration of phenobarbital may decrease the effect of estradiol by increasing its metabolism.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Hepatic enzyme-inducing drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone, rifampin) can increase valproate clearance, while enzyme inhibitors (e.g., felbamate) can decrease valproate clearance.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For example, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital (or primidone) can double the clearance of valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thus, patients on monotherapy will generally have longer half-lives and higher concentrations than patients receiving polytherapy with antiepilepsy drugs.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Rufinamide Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, rufinamide clearance was decreased by valproate.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Rufinamide concentrations were increased by <16% to 70%, dependent on concentration of valproate (with the larger increases being seen in pediatric patients at high doses or concentrations of valproate).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Patients stabilized on rufinamide before being prescribed valproate should begin valproate therapy at a low dose, and titrate to a clinically effective dose.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Similarly, patients on valproate should begin at a rufinamide dose lower than 10 mg/kg per day (pediatric patients) or 400 mg per day (adults).	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	Protein binding of valproate is reduced in the elderly, in patients with chronic hepatic diseases, in patients with renal impairment, and in the presence of other drugs (e.g., aspirin).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Conversely, valproate may displace certain protein-bound drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, warfarin, and tolbutamide).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	For example, patients taking enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital) will clear valproate more rapidly.	Pharmacokinetic interaction

5	In the fed state, praziquantel (40 mg/kg) increased mean maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve of albendazole sulfoxide by about 50% in healthy subjects (n = 10) compared with a separate group of subjects (n = 6) given albendazole alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Albendazole sulfoxide concentrations in bile and cystic fluid were increased (about 2-fold) in hydatid cyst patients treated with cimetidine (10 mg/kg/day) (n = 7) compared with albendazole (20 mg/kg/day) alone (n = 12).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Oral bioavailability appears to be enhanced when albendazole is coadministered with a fatty meal (estimated fat content 40 grams) as evidenced by higher (up to 5-fold on average) plasma concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide as compared to the fasted state.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	However, CONTRAVE should not be taken with a high-fat meal because of a resulting significant increase in bupropion and naltrexone systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During concomitant use with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel), the maximum recommended daily dose of CONTRAVE is two tablets (one tablet each morning and evening).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6: Bupropion inhibits CYP2D6 and can increase concentrations of: antidepressants, (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and many tricyclics), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide): Consider dose reduction when using with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Concomitant Treatment with CYP2B6 Inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel) can increase bupropion exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Do not exceed one tablet twice daily when taken with CYP2B6 inhibitors.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Studies in animals demonstrate that the acute toxicity of bupropion is enhanced by the MAOI phenelzine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	CONTRAVE increased metoprolol AUC and Cmax by approximately 4- and 2-fold, respectively, relative to metoprolol alone.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Similar clinical drug interactions resulting in increased pharmacokinetic exposure of CYP2D6 substrates have also been observed with bupropion as a single agent with desipramine or venlafaxine.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Coadministration of CONTRAVE with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isozyme including certain antidepressants (SSRIs and many tricyclics), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	If CONTRAVE is added to the treatment regimen of a patient already receiving a drug metabolized by CYP2D6, the need to decrease the dose of the original medication should be considered, particularly for those concomitant medications with a narrow therapeutic index.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Inhibitors of CYP2B6: Ticlopidine and Clopidogrel: Concomitant treatment with these drugs can increase bupropion exposure but decrease hydroxybupropion exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	During concomitant use with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel), the CONTRAVE daily dose should not exceed two tablets (one tablet each morning and evening).	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The systemic concentrations of substrate drugs transported by OCT2 (such as amantadine, amiloride, cimetidine, dopamine, famotidine, memantine, metformin, pindolol, procainamide, ranitidine, varenicline, oxaliplatin) are likely to increase as a result of reduced renal clearance when coadministered with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Food Effect on Absorption When CONTRAVE was administered with a high-fat meal, the AUC and Cmax for naltrexone increased 2.1-fold and 3.7-fold, respectively, and the AUC and Cmax for bupropion increased 1.4-fold and 1.8-fold, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	At steady state, the food effect increased AUC and Cmax for naltrexone by 1.7-fold and 1.9-fold, respectively, and increased AUC and Cmax for bupropion by 1.1-fold and 1.3-fold, respectively.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Thus, CONTRAVE should not be taken with high-fat meals because of the resulting significant increases in bupropion and naltrexone systemic exposure.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	In vitro studies suggest that paroxetine, sertraline, norfluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and nelfinavir inhibit the hydroxylation of bupropion.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	The systemic concentrations of substrate drugs transported by OCT2 are likely to increase as a result of reduced renal clearance when coadministered with CONTRAVE.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	While not systematically studied, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or phenytoin may induce the metabolism of bupropion.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
5	Chlorpheniramine may inhibit the hepatic metabolism of phenytoin, monitor phenytoin toxicity.	Pharmacokinetic interaction
